# Microsoft Responsibilities when Running an Embed App  
[!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] is a cloud service for small to medium-sized businesses that is built on and for Microsoft Azure. It provides organizations with a business management solution that helps companies connect their financials, sales, service, and operations to streamline business processes, improve customer interactions and make better decisions.

The [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] service brings together the business management solution, business intelligence, infrastructure, computing, and database services in a single offering that enables organizations to run industry-specific [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)]s from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), without the hassle of managing infrastructure.

The [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] service model distinguishes specific roles and responsibilities for ISVs, Implementation Partners (VARs), and Microsoft throughout the life cycle of the service. Microsoft maintains the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] service by deploying, actively monitoring, and servicing the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] and customers’ production tenants that are running on the service. This includes allocating the required system infrastructure to run the service and proactively communicating to customers about the service’s health (which is done through the Service Health dashboard in the Office 365 Admin Portal).

Microsoft responsibilities in the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)]  service include:
