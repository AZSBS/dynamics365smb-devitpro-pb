# Deployment Topologies

A [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] deployment consists of various components that support the production, development, and testing. These components can be installed on various computers. The deployment process varies depending on the topology that you implement. This article provides an overview of the supported topologies. 

<!-- 
This section describes how to install and configure the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](../developer/includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] in different network topologies.

## Deployment Scenarios  
  
|Topology|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|More information|  
|--------------|---------------------------------------|---|  
|Demonstration|Installs the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](../developer/includes/nav_tablet_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../developer/includes/nav_windows_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_dev_long](../developer/includes/nav_dev_long_md.md)], and the [!INCLUDE[demolong](../developer/includes/demolong_md.md)] and company on a single computer. The scenario lets you install and test the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] features and behavior in a simple network topology by using the default settings of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] Setup. The installation requires minimal preparation and hardware resources.|
