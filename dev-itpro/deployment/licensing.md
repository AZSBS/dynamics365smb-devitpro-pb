# Licensing in Dynamics 365 Business Central

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] licenses can only be purchased through CSP. Microsoft offers several types of paid licenses (users):

- Essential  
- Premium  
- Team Member  
- External Accountant  

Customers can also subscribe for an evaluation version by using self-service sign-up (also known as IW or viral sign-up). This subscription comes with 10000 licenses and allows customers to evaluate the functionality of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] using non-production companies.  

[!include[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] does not use the classic [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] license files (*.flf). Instead, permissions are generated based on entitlements.  

We define license permissions (per object) in the **Entitlements** table. Entitlements are grouped in the **Entitlement Set** table, and then each entitlement set is associated with one of the four Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service plans.  

This means that when a user purchases, for example, an Essential license and tries to sign in to Business Central, we retrieve the userâ€™s service plan (in this case Essential) from Azure AD and then load the corresponding entitlements as license permissions.
