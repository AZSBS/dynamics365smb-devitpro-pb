# Qualification and Onboarding of ISV Partners to [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)]
 
[!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] Qualification requirements are being finalized by the owners. The main criteria for [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] Onboarding at this point are: 
-   Partner must provide all day, every day support. Their customers do not get to call Microsoft support. They always call the partner. 
-   Partner must live up to the standards for documentation that Microsoft outlined in the CFMD program. Good documentation is part of [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] success and uptake, and it also lowers the work load on their support center. 
-   Partner is committed to stay on the supported platform. 
-   Partner provides an SLA for requests from Microsoft towards the partner (TBD)   
-   Partners must have support agreement with Microsoft

For [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)]s coming with a (code-customized) Base App included will have additional volume (number of users) requirements associated with it. 
When an [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] is qualified for onboarding into [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] service, the ISV will need to provide the following information about the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] to the Microsoftâ€™s onboarding team: 
-   The name of the application to be used for the client and web service URL, for example, an ISV for the fabrikamapples app would provide the following information: 
    -   Client:  https://fabrikamapples.bc.dynamics.com 
    -   Web Services:  https://fabrikamapples.api.bc.dynamics.com  
-   Entitlements for their ISV objects, per license type. See the Licensing section for more detail.  
The rest of the information will be included with the [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_embed_app_md](../developer/includes/d365_bus_central_embed_app_md.md)] package that the partner deploys through LCS.
