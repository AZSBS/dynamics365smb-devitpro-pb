# Migrate Legacy Help to the [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] Format

When you move to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], you can reuse your existing product Help solution in most situations, especially if the content is already published to an internal or external website. In that case, all you have to do is to add that website to the configuration of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. For more information, see [Configuring the Help Experience](../deployment/configure-help.md).  

If your existing content is in a different format, such as PDF files, Word documents, or printed manuals, you must decide if you want to keep the content as-is, or if you want to convert it to a format that can be accessed from inside [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].  

If you are migrating your solution from [!INCLUDE[navsicily_md](../developer/includes/navsicily_md.md)] or later versions of [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md), then you most likely have been using the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md) Help Server, and your Help articles are in HTML format. That means that you can use publicly available third-party solutions to convert your HTML files to MarkDown, if you want to follow similar processes to the ones the Microsoft team follows.
