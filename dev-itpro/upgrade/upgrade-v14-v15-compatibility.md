# [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] Upgrade Compatibility Matrix

When upgrading from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] Spring 2019 (version 14) to [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] 2019 release wave 2 (version 15), it is important that your Business Central 14 version is compatible with the Business Central 15 version that you want to upgrade to.

The following table lists the Business Central 14 versions and the minimum Business Central 15 version that is compatible for upgrade.

|Business Central 14 version (update)|Minimum compatible Business Central 15 version|
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
|[14.0 (GA and cumulative update 01)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4501146)|15.0|
|[14.3 (cumulative update 02)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4514872)|15.0|
|[14.4 (cumulative update 03)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4515445)|15.0|
|[14.5 (cumulative update 04)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4518535)|15.0|
|[14.6 (cumulative update 05)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4522949)|15.1|
|[14.7 (cumulative update 06)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4528705)|15.2|
|[14.8 (cumulative update 07)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4533396)|15.3|
|[14.9 (cumulative update 08)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4536555)|15.3|

For example, looking at the matrix, you can upgrade Business Central 14.0 (cumulative update 01) to any Business Central 15 version. However, you can only upgrade Business Central 14.5 (cumulative update 04) to Business Central 15.1 or later.
