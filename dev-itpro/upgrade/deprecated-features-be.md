# Deprecated Features in the Belgian Version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Belgium that has been removed from Dynamics 365 Business Central, made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## ISABEL integration
The possibility to integrate to upload and download bank files through ISABEL.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Removed| This feature uses an Automation that is not supported by the Dynamics 365 Business Central compiler and blocks the C/AL to AL conversion. We previously disabled this functionality. It has now been removed. Integration to ISABEL can be made by partners that want to offer this functionality to their customers.
