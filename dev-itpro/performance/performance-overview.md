# Performance Overview

The following sections help you understand and improve the performance of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. The content is centered around the different ways a functional consultant, a developer, or an administrator can make changes with a performance impact.

- Visit [Application](performance-application.md) to learn about how in-product configurations affect performance.
- Visit [Developer](performance-developer.md) to learn about how to code for performance in AL.
- Visit [Online](performance-online.md) to learn more about performance in the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] service.
- Visit [On-Premises](performance-onprem.md) to learn more about the various ways the different components in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] can be configured to achieve better performance for an on-premises installation.
- Visit [How to Work with a Performance Problem](performance-work-perf-problem.md) to learn more on how to tackle a performance problem.


The video series *Performance Considerations when Building an App* is also a good starting point to learn more about performance of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]:

- [Performance Considerations when Building an App, Part I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MooYL05V11Y)

  This first part of performance considerations videos focusses on basic principles. It makes you aware of why it is essential to consider performance in every line of code you write, and it introduces the performance implications of the general architectural document and posting design patterns of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].
  
- [Performance Considerations when Building an App, Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN7V4GyULtY)

  Learn about best practices on implementing the existing data retrieval methods, learn how to greatly improve performance by minimizing server roundtrips, and get introduced to important dos and don'ts when coding for performance.
