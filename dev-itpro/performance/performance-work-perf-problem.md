# How to work with a performance problem
What do you do if users complain that "it is slow"? In this section, we describe a troubleshooting process that can help to guide you to find the root cause of the problem.

Before getting started on solving a performance tuning problem, it often helps to define and quantify "slow" and also negotiate acceptable values for execution time of "slow" operations with users. This is sometimes called "establishing a baseline." 

To solve a performance problem, a common pattern is to do iterations of
1. Measure system performance and collecting performance data
2. Locate a bottleneck
3. Eliminate the bottleneck
until the "slow" operations are comparable to the established baseline.
