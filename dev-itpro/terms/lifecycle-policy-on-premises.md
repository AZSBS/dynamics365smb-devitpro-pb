# Software Lifecycle Policy and Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premises Updates

This topic outlines the lifecycle and support policies for [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] on-premises updates.

## Fixed Lifecycle Policy

[!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] (on-premises) software is covered by the Fixed Lifecycle Policy.  

Licensed customers must stay current with updates to the [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] on-premises software in accordance with the following servicing and system requirements. This policy requires that the customer maintain Software Assurance (SA) or the Enhancement Plan, and that it deploy updates as noted later in this topic.  

## On-premises software update policies

The customer is in full control of its on-premises deployments and must follow this policy. The customer is in control of installing updates in its on-premises environments. Microsoft will support the [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] (on-premises) software as indicated on the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy for Business Central on-premises](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=business%20central%20on) page, but only if the customer keeps the deployed software current according to this policy.  

Critical fixes and non-critical updates are handled in the following way:

- **Critical fixes** – Critical fixes include security fixes and any fixes that are required to support reliability and availability. Critical fixes will be made available in the latest platform update version.

- **Non-critical updates** – Customers must update to the most current Dynamics 365 Business Central to deploy non-critical updates.
