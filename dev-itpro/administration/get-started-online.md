# Get Started as a Reseller of Business Central Online

If you want to build your business on [!INCLUDE [prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)] online, you must get set up as a reseller in the Microsoft Partner Center. We also recommend that you [join the Ready to Go program](../developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go).  

## Get set up in the Partner Center

[!INCLUDE [csp-get-started](../developer/includes/csp-get-started.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-admin-users](../developer/includes/csp-admin-users.md)]

## Join the Ready to Go program

The “Ready to Go” program is designed to support you in the journey of bringing offerings to market. The program contains learning, coaching, and tooling. For more information, see [Ready to Go](../developer/readiness/readiness-ready-to-go).  

## Help your customers get started

When you onboard customers to [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], you have access to their account as a delegated administrator and can help them get things set up. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md).  

### Connect with customers

[!INCLUDE [csp-connect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-connect-customer.md)]

### Give powerful demos

You can create a trial environment based on the [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] content pack in [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/).  

[!INCLUDE [admin_m365demo](../developer/includes/admin_m365demo.md)]

For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).
