# Analyzing Outgoing Web Service Request Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2.md](../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

Outgoing web service request telemetry gathers data about outgoing web service requests sent using the AL HTTPClient module. As a partner, the data give insight into the execution time and failures that happen in external services that your environment and extensions depend. Use the data to monitor environments for performance issues caused by external services, and be more proactive in preventing issues from occurring.

## General dimensions

The following table explains the general dimensions included in an outgoing **Web Services Call** trace. The table lists the dimensions that are specific to Business Central.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|-----------|
|message|**Web Service Called (Outgoing): {endpoint}**|
|severityLevel|**1**|

## Custom dimensions

The following table explains the custom dimensions included in a **Web Services Call** trace.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|aadTenantId|Specifies that Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant ID used for Azure AD authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Azure AD authentication, this value is **common**. |
|alAuthenticationMethod|Specifies the user authentication used by the service of the AL object that was run by request. Values include: Windows, UserName, NavUserPassword, AccessControlService. For more information about the authentication types, see [Authentication and Credential Types](users-credential-types.md).|
|alHttpTimeout|Specifies the timeout defined for the request. The timeout is the time to wait before the request is canceled. The value has the format hh:mm:ss. <br /><br />The timeout is defined either by the [NavHttpClientMaxTimeout](configure-server-instance.md#Development) setting on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance or by a [TimeOut method](../developer/methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-timeout-method) call in extension code. The TimeOut method call takes precedence. |
|alObjectId|Specifies the ID of the AL object that made the request.|
|alObjectName|Specifies the name of the AL object that made the request.|
|alObjectType|Specifies the type of the AL object that made the request.|
|companyName|Specifies the display name of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] company from which the request was made.|
|component|**Dynamics 365 Business Central Server**|
|componentVersion|Specifies the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] version number.|
|deprecatedKeys|A comma-separated list of all the keys that have been deprecated. The keys in this list are still supported but will eventually be removed in the next major release. We recommend that update any queries that use these keys to use the new key name.|
|endpoint|Specifies the endpoint for the request. The endpoint is cleaned to include only the base URI. |
|environmentName|Specifies the name of the tenant environment. See [Managing Environments](tenant-admin-center-environments.md).|
|environmentType|Specifies the environment type for the tenant, such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, **Trial**. See [Environment Types](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#types-of-environments)|
|eventId|**RT0019**|
|extensionId|Specifies the appID of the extension that made the request.|
|extensionName|Specifies the name of the extension that made the request.|
|extensionVersion|Specifies the version of the extension that made the request.|
|httpMethod|Specifies the HTTP method used in the outgoing request. Values include: POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, orâ€¯DELETE. |
|httpReturnCode |Specifies the http status code returned when a request has completed. This dimension further indicates whether request succeeded or not, and why. Use it to verify whether there was an issue with a request even though the request was logged as successful. The dimension displays one of the following values: <ul><li>**200** <br />OK. The request succeeded.</li><li>**401**<br />Access denied. The user who made the request doesn't have proper permissions. For more information, see [Web Services Authentication](../webservices/web-services-authentication.md) and [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-define-granular-permissions). </li><li>**404**<br />Not found. The given endpoint wasn't valid.</li><li>**408**<br />Request timed out. The request took longer to complete than the threshold configured for the service. For information about this threshold in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online, see [OData request limits](operational-limits-online.md#ODataServices). For on-premises, the timeout is determined by the ODataServicesOperationTimeout setting of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#ODataServices)</li><li>**429**<br /> Too Many Requests. The request exceeded the maximum simultaneous requests allowed on the service. For information about this threshold in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] online, see [OData request limits](operational-limits-online.md#ODataServices). For on-premises, the timeout is determined by the ODataMaxConnections setting of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#ODataServices)</li></ul>|
|serverExecutionTime|Specifies the amount of time it took the server to complete the request, including the time to open the company. The time has the format hh:mm:ss.sssssss.|
|totalTime|Specifies the amount of time it took to process the request, including the time to open the company. The time has the format hh:mm:ss.sssssss. <br /><br />|
|telemetrySchemaVersion|Specifies the version of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] telemetry schema.|
