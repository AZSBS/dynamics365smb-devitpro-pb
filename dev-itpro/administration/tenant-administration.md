# Tenant Administration for Business Central

As a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner, you are the administrator of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] tenants of your customers. You have access to the administration tools of their Office 365 account and their [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] administration center where you can specify upgrade windows, for example.  

## Extending trials

A prospect can sign up for a free trial of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. When they first sign up for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], they get access to an evaluation version that does not include all capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. If they then enable the 30 day trial experience, this enables all capabilities. However, sometimes 30 days is not quite enough to decide if they want to buy [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]. In that case, they can extend their trial with an additional 30 days. For more information, see [Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-extend-trial?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration&bc=../breadcrumb/toc.yml).  

If the prospect wants to extend the trial further than those 30 days, you can extend it another 30 days. After that, you as the delegated administrator can log into their [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] and extend the trial using the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. However, after those additional 30 days, the prospect must either purchase [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], or you can ask Microsoft for an additional extension of the trial by contacting Support.
