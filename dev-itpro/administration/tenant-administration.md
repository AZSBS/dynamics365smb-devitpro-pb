# Administration of Business Central Online

As a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] reselling partner, you are the administrator of the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] tenants of your customers. You have access to the administration tools of their Office 365 account and their [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] administration center where you can specify upgrade windows, for example.  

## Get started with the Cloud Solution provider program

You must enroll in the Cloud Solution Provider program in order to service Business Central online. In the Microsoft Partner Center documentation, you can learn how to [add a customer](/partner-center/add-a-new-customer?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration&bc=../breadcrumb/toc.yml), [assign licenses to users](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration&bc=../breadcrumb/toc.yml), and [create new subscriptions](/partner-center/create-a-new-subscription?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration&bc=../breadcrumb/toc.yml). [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] is one of the subscriptions that you can create, and there are [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]-specific license types that you can assign to users.  

## Extending trials

A prospect can sign up for a free trial of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. When they first sign up for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], they get access to an evaluation version that does not include all capabilities in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. If they then enable the 30 day trial experience, this enables all capabilities. However, sometimes 30 days is not quite enough to decide if they want to buy [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. In that case, they can extend their trial with an additional 30 days. For more information, see [Need More Time to Decide Whether to Subscribe?](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-extend-trial?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration&bc=../breadcrumb/toc.yml).  

If the prospect wants to extend the trial further than those 30 days, you can extend it another 30 days if you, as the delegated administrator, log into their [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] and extend the trial using the same **Extend Trial Period** guide. However, after those additional 30 days, the prospect must either purchase [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], or you can ask Microsoft for an additional extension of the trial by contacting Support.  

> [!TIP]
> You can suggest your prospects sign up for a trial, but you can also set up a customized demonstration environment based on your sandbox environment. This way, you can easily add or remove functionality based on your prospects' expectations. For more information, see [Choosing Your Dynamics 365 Business Central Development Sandbox Environment](../developer/devenv-sandbox-overview.md).
