# Managing Technical Support

If users report that they are having a problem with [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], superusers and the internal administrator can often find a solution. The internal administrator can find technical information in the **Help and Support** page as described in the following sections, and they can then escalate relevant issues to the reselling partner.  

The reselling partner can log in to their customer's [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] as the delegated admin for troubleshooting. Both internal administrators and the reselling partner can use the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to manage environments and upgrades.  

## Finding technical information

The **Help and Support** page is a powerful tool for you to find technical information about your customers' [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], both online and on-premises. The **Troubleshooting** section gives easy access to the most recent error message, and it has a link to inspect pages for further troubleshooting.

Also in the **Help and Support** page, users can see your support contact information, and they and you can see which version of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], the tenant is on.  

As an administrator, you also have access to this information in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]. You can use the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to easily navigate to your customers' tenants, and you can create sandbox environments that can help troubleshoot any issues reported by your customers. For more information, see [The Business Central Administration Center](tenant-admin-center.md).  

### Azure Active Directory tenant

If you have configured the support email address, and your customer uses that to contact you, then the **Help and Support** page encourages them to include information about their Azure Active Directory tenant ID in the email. This information is shown at the bottom of the **Help and Support** page. You can use that to identify the tenant in the administration center, and you can use it to log into their tenant.  

You also have access to this information in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)].  

### Version

You can use the information about which version the tenant is on to help you troubleshoot the issue that the customer has reported, for example. This information is listed in the **Troubleshooting** section of the **Help and Support** page. For more information, see [Version numbers in Business Central](version-numbers.md).  

### Last known error

The link behind the sentence *View the last known error* will find and show the most recent error message that was was generated by the application code. This includes errors from field validation, posting routines, and other code behind business functionality.  

The information that you can get from this link includes the following:

- Text

    This is the error message that the user sees, either in a dialog window or next to a user interface element that cannot render, for example.
- Code

    This is the code snippet that threw the error.
- Callstack

    This shows how the error was triggered.
- Object

    This shows information about the runtime objects.

The link cannot open errors that were generated by the platform. So if you suspect that the issue is caused by the platform, you can try to reproduce the error in a sandbox environment before you contact Microsoft for support. For more information, see [Create a sandbox environment](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#create-a-sandbox-environment).

## Escalating your customer's support issues

Sometimes the tenant has run into a problem that you cannot resolve. In those cases, the reselling partner can use the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] to easily submit a support request to Microsoft.  

For more information, see [Submitting support requests on behalf of your customer](tenant-admin-center.md#submitting-support-requests-on-behalf-of-your-customer).
