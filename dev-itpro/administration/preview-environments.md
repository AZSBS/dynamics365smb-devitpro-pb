# Prepare for major updates with preview environments

[!INCLUDE [admin-previews](../developer/includes/admin-previews.md)]

## Practice and test

Once you have the preview, start using it:

1. Review the new functionality. Try it out, and begin training employees on the new features that are coming.

2. Validate your extensions.

    Upload and install your extensions into the sandbox environments created on the preview version and run through the functionality. Verify that the customization continues to work and is compatible with the new version.  

    In rare cases, if you discover any changes required for your per-tenant extension to become compatible with the next release, apply the changes to your app, test it again on a sandbox environment running on a preview version. then, if tests complete successfully, upload the app into your production environment, setting **Deploy to** field to **Next major version**. This way the compatible version of your app will be used when you schedule upgrade of your production environment to Wave 1 2020 release once it becomes available.

3. Test the quality. If you run into issues related to the preview, please provide the feedback following the steps outlined above.

Finally, as always, if you have ideas for features you would like to see in future releases of Business Central, let us know at [https://aka.ms/bcideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas).

### Provide feedback on the preview

We need your feedback on the preview! Let us know about your experiences with the new version. You can provide feedback on Microsoft Collaborate:

1. Browse to [aka.ms/collaborate](https://aka.ms/collaborate)

2. If you have not registered before, please complete the registration form to access Collaborate

3. Choose Engagements, and then choose Join

4. Under the **Ready! for Dynamics 365 Business Central program**, find **2020 Release Wave 1 Preview** in the list of available engagements, and choose **Join**

Once you have joined the 2020 Release Wave 1 engagement, you can submit your feedback by filling in the form. You must specify if you are reporting a technical issue, a translation issue, or a documentation issue. The default severity is set to 3, which is the normal severity for most defects and means that the system is not crashing and users are not blocked from doing their work, but you can change that. When we have triaged your issue, you can see changes in Collaborate.
