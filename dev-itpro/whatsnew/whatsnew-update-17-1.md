## Good to know

**NEW! Migrate directly from version 14, 15, and 16 to Business Central Online**  
Business Central includes a cloud migration tool that administrators can use to migrate customer data from on-premises databases to Business Central online. Starting now, the Cloud Migration app also supports migration from the earlier on-premises versions of Business Central, with the latest cumulative update applied: Migrate directly from versions 14.x, 15.x, and 16.x to version 17.x. 
This helps customers reduce their costs of migrating to the Business Central cloud significantly, as they can skip upgrading their on-premises environments to the latest version of Business Central and just migrate the data, including all historical transactions. The Cloud Migration app now includes all the necessary data upgrade logic to convert the data from the previous versions to the data structure of 2020 release wave 2 (version 17.0). Learn more 
 [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migrate-business-central-on-premises).

**Watch what's new sessions on demand**  
Watch the sessions from the Business Central Launch Event in October. Register and get access to 30+ sessions [here](https://aka.ms/MSDyn365BCLaunchEvent).

**Snapshot debugging**  
Snapshot debugging has now been enabled for sandbox environments. It will be enabled in production in a later minor. Learn more [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-snapshot-debugging).

**Apps are moving to office.com**  
The home for all your business applications across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform is moving to office.com, where you'll find the Business Central tiles for production and sandbox environments. Read more [here]().

**Easy access to production or sandbox environments from the mobile app**
Users of mobile devices can now choose between their sandbox and production environments without the need to use the pre-crafted URL as before. Partners running their own apps based on Business Central can also let their users explore it from mobile devices. Learn more [here](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/access-multiple-production-or-sandbox-environments-mobile-apps).

**Unblock multifactor authentication for mobile apps**
We have updated core authentication components of the mobile app to support multifactor authentication. Enabling such flow in the user setting on your Microsoft 365 account and then using it on a mobile device (via an SMS code, authenticator app, or more) is now possible after updating the Business Central mobile app to version 3.0 or higher. Learn more [here](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/unblock-multi-factor-authentication-mobile-apps).
