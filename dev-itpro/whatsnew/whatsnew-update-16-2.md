## Good to know
**A change to the Web client header**  
The top-most header in the Business Central Web client and desktop app have been updated to align with other Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 apps. The most notable change is to the height of the header that has now been reduced to 48 pixels.

**User alert for performance impact when using RapidStart packages to import data**
Using RapidStart packages to quickly import data (incl. big data) to Business Central could impact the performance of the tenant. This new, small feature analyzes if import of data is possible and will warn the user of potential impact to performance of the tenant. In case of risk of performance impact, alternative ways to import or request for partner help will be suggested.
