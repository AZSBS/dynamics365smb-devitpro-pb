## Partner Supported Countries and Translations
In countries, where Microsoft has not delivered a [localization](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-develop-localization), partners can build localizations using translation and localization apps that are published in AppSource. You can apply for access to build a localization on top of the international (W1) version of Dynamics 365 Business Central. The following table provides the list of countries and translation supported through partners.
