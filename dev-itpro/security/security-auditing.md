# Security Auditing in Business Central

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] includes a change log that lets you track all direct modifications a user makes to data in the database. The change log can track changes to specific application tables. Plus, it always logs changes to various system tables, which enables you to track changes to security sub-systems like users and permissions.

The change log can be turned on and off. However, it is turned on be default.
