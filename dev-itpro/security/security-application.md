# Application Security in Business Central

## Intro to Gold Standard

## Authorization 

For users to access the application, they must be have a valid user account in the application. Then, they must be granted permissions to the various areas of the application, based on their role. The management of user accounts and permissions is done from the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] client. For more information, see the following articles in the Business Central application help:

-   [Managing Users and Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions)  

-   [Understanding Users, Profiles, and Role Centers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/admin-users-profiles-roles)

## Authentication
Before users can sign-in to the application, they must be authenticated as valid user in the system. [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] supports several authentication methods. You configure the authentication method on the server-tiers of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].

For more information, see [Authentication and Credential Types](../administration/users-credential-types.md).

## Auditing

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] provides options for limiting and monitoring user access to the database.
