# Inspecting and Troubleshooting Pages

The [!INCLUDE[webclient](includes/webclient.md)] includes a page inspection feature that lets you get details about a page, providing insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data it displays. Page inspection helps you:

- Learn the data model behind a page.
- Discover pages and parts that can be reused in you application design.
- Troubleshoot data issues without having to perform tasks like copying the production database, viewing the entire source table, or digging into SQL.
- Debug the application.

To inspect a page, open the [!INCLUDE[webclient](includes/webclient.md)], and in the top right corner, choose ![Settings icon](media/settings_icon_small.png), then choose **Inspect**. Or, you can use the keyboard shortcut Crtl+Alt+F1.

For more information about inspecting a page, see [Inspecting Pages in Business Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/across-inspect-page) in the Business Central Application help.
