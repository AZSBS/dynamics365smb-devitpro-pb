In the Microsoft 365 admin center and Microsoft Azure Management portal, customers and partners can invite external users (guests) into the Active Directory. When a partner user is added as a guest to the customer's Azure AD, they no longer can log in as a delegated admin into the customer's [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)]. In order to log in, the local user (guests or native) must have a valid [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] license assigned to them.
