About one month before a major update, you can try out new functionality in preview environments. Preview environments are essentially [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] online sandbox envionments that you create on a preview version of the application. When you create the new sandbox environment, choose the preview version marked as *(Preview)* from the version list. This creates a new sandbox environment with a preview version of the application.  

To submit your feedback and potential issues you discover in the preview version of the application you must have access to Microsoft Collaborate. For more information about getting access to Collaborate, see [Register on Collaborate](../readiness/readiness-add-on-apps-getting-you-started.md#register-on-collaborate).

> [!NOTE]
> Previews roll out gradually across the world, so if the option is not showing up for you today, please try again tomorrow.

The newly created preview sandbox environment contains demonstration company data. Trying the preview on a copy of your current production data is not yet supported; nor is testing the upgrade from your current version to the preview. However, the newly created sandbox environment can be used for exploring and learning the new product capabilities as well as validating that your per-tenant extensions are working as expected with the upcoming release version of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)].

If you run your tests on a preview environment one month before the announced major release of [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)], this will will help make sure that the subsequent upgrades of your production environments will go smoother. This way, you, your customers, and your code are better prepared for the official release.

We expect to update the preview version only if we discover critical issues before the major update is generally available for production environments. Apart from these potential fixes, we do not expect any further changes to the product between the preview and the official release. This means that you can start your testing and learning activities immediately, without waiting for the official release.

> [!NOTE]
> You will be able to test the update on a copy of your production data in a sandbox environment when we release the new update in production in April or October, respectively. When the official release becomes available, you can continue your tests on that version. You will no longer be able to create new preview sandboxes.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The preview version as well as all sandbox environments that are based on it will be removed 30 days after the official release becomes available.
