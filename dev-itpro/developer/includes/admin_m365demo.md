1. Log in to [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/) using your partner account.
2. Choose the **My Environments** tab, and then, under **My tenants**, choose the **Create Tenant** button.
3. As the type, choose **Quick Tenant**.
4. As the period, choose either a quarter or a full year.

    As a partner, you can have 1 one year tenant at a time. So if you want more tenants, we suggest that you choose 90-Day tenants.
5. As the location, choose the region that is closest to your location.
6. Choose the **Microsoft 365 Business Demo Content** content pack, and then choose the **Create Tenant** button.

    This gives you all you need for the next step. But you can use the **Microsoft 365 Enterprise Demo Content** if you need more users for your demo, or you want to demo more complex Microsoft 365 integration scenarios, for example.

    > [!TIP]
    > There is also a [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] content pack if all you need is [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)].
7. In an in-private browser window, go to [https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/BusinessCentral](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/BusinessCentral) and sign up for a free trial. Use the administrator account that you just created, typically called something like admin@M365B265757.onmicrosoft.com.

This gives you a [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)] environment with two companies:

- The CRONUS demonstration company
- An empty company with the name *My Company*, but it might have a different display name for demo purposes

If you go to the **Companies** list in [!INCLUDE [prodshort](prodshort.md)], you will see that the demonstration company is marked as an evaluation company and does not have a subscription. This is why, if you want to demo something that requires a subscription, you have to switch to the empty My Company.  

You can use the demonstration company for as long as you like. Provided that you use it at least a couple of times per week, the company remains available for as long as your Office 365 account is still valid.  

Because you are logged in as the internal Office 365 administrator, you can now go to the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](prodadmincenter.md)] and create a new production or sandbox environment, depending on your needs. For more information, see [Managing Environments](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

In this new environment, you can set things up the way you want. You can log in with the demo user account, often called meganb@M365B123456.onmicrosoft.com or something similar, for the non-administrator experience. You can also switch to the empty My Company in this environment, and then, when the 30 day trial expires, you just create a new environment. You can use Excel or RapidStart Services to reuse data, for example.
