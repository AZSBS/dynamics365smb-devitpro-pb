You can still download the files that were made available for [!INCLUDE [nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)]. The download consists of 45 CAB files with the content from the [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] 2016 DVD rebranded to [!INCLUDE [nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)]. The download includes CAB files with the W1 application Help translated into each of the supported languages plus the local functionality for the country/region where that language is spoken. There are also CAB files with local functionality in English. The files were published as a single download so each administrator could choose exactly the files that they needed at the time. For more information, see [Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Classic Help Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54315).  

However, you must switch to the UI-to-Help mapping functionality that is described in [Configure Context-Sensitive Help](../help/context-sensitive-help.md). For more information, see [Adding page-level UI-to-Help mapping to the system table](../help/context-sensitive-help.md#adding-page-level-ui-to-help-mapping-to-the-system-table).
