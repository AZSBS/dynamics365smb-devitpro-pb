> Internet browsers can only handle one file per request. Therefore, with the Web client, if this method is called in a repetitive statement (or loop) that generates multiple files, only the last file will be sent to the browser. Alternatively, when designing for the Web client, you can bundle the files into a single archive (.zip) file.
