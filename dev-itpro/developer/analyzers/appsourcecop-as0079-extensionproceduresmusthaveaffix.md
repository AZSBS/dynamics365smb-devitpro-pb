# AppSourceCop Rule AS0079
An affix is required for procedures defined in extension objects.  

## Description
An affix is required for procedures defined in extension objects, because it prevents breaking dependent extensions that reference it in case a procedure with the same signature is introduced by the base object or by another extension.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

We recommend following these best practices when developing extensions in AL to ensure consistency and discoverability on file, object, and method naming, as well as better readability of written code.

Built-in methods and types are not included in this rule because they are written using Pascal case.

## Bad code example

```
trigger OnValidate()
BEGIN
    IF "Order Date" > "Starting Date" THEN
       Error(Text007, FieldCaption("Order Date"), FieldCaption("Starting Date"));
END;

VAR
    Text007: Label '%1 cannot be greater than %2.';
```

## Good code example

```
trigger OnValidate()
begin
    if "Order Date" > "Starting Date" then
       Error(Text007, FieldCaption("Order Date"), FieldCaption("Starting Date"));
end;

var
    Text007: Label '%1 cannot be greater than %2.';

```

## Good and bad practices for fixing the rule
Change every reserved language keyword to use lowercase letters.
