# Extensible Enums
An enumeration type, also known as an enum in programming, is a keyword used to declare a type that consists of a set of named constants. The list of named constants is called the enumeration list. Enums can be used as table fields, local and global variables, and parameters.

To declare an `enum` in AL you must specify an ID and a name. The enumeration list consists of values and each of the values are declared with an ID and a value. The value ID is the ordinal value on the enumeration list and must be unique. The following example shows an enum, which can be extended, and has the four values; **None**, **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**. 

```
enum 50121 Loyalty
{
	Extensible = true;
	
	value(0; None) { }
	value(1; Bronze) { }
	value(2; Silver) { }
	value(3; Gold)
	{
		Caption = 'Gold Customer';
	}
}
```

Enums can be extended in order to add more values to the enumeration list in which case the `Extensible` property must be set to `true`. The syntax for an enum extension, which extends the **Loyalty** enum with the value **Diamond**, is shown below.

```
enumextension 50130 LoyaltyWithDiamonds extends Loyalty
{
	value(50130; Diamond)
	{
		Caption = 'Diamond Level';
	}
}
```

## Usage
When referencing a defined enum from code, you use the following syntax:
`enum Loyalty`

If you want to define an enum as a table field type, 

`field(50100; Loyal; enum Loyalty) {}`

Or, as a variable:

```
var
	LoyaltyLevel: enum Loyalty;
``Â´
