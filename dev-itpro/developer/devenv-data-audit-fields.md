# Data Audit Fields in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2](../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

Tables in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] include the following four system fields for the purpose of auditing records:

- SystemCreatedAt - specifies the data and time that the record was created
- SystemCreatedBy - specifies security ID (SID) of the user that created the record 
- SystemLastModifiedAt - specifies the data and time that the record was last modified.
- SystemLastModifiedBy - specifies the SID of the user that last modified the record

Data audit fields are exposed by the platform code in AL code, allowing developers to code against them.

## Static characteristics

The data audit fields have the following static characteristics:

|Field name (in AL) |Column name (in database)|Data type|Field number|
|----------------|----------------------|--------|------------|
|SystemCreatedAt|$SystemCreatedAt |DateTime|2000000001|
|SystemCreatedBy  |$SystemCreatedBy |GUID |2000000002|
|SystemLastModifiedAt|$SystemLastModifiedAt |DateTime|2000000003|
|SystemLastModifiedBy|$SystemLastModifiedBy |GUID|2000000004|

## Runtime characteristics

At runtime, the data audit fields have the following characteristics and behavior: 

-  The platform will automatically generate and assign values on the following  

   - After all OnBefore[Modify|Insert] events
   - After the Modify/Insert trigger 
   - Before all OnAfter[Modify|Insert] events

   You can't assign your own values to any of the audit fields.

- When a new record is created, before calling Insert, the audit fields are given blank GUIDs and blank dates as values.

- When a record is first inserted, the fields are populated with actual values. The SystemCreatedBy and SystemLastModifiedBy are given the same value at this point. So are the SystemCreatedAt and SystemLastModifiedAt fields.

    The SystemCreatedBy and SystemCreatedAt will not change after this point.

- When a record is updated, the SystemLastModifiedBy and SystemLastModifiedAt fields are changed.

- The following operations won't change the values of audit fields:

  - Copy company. The values in the tables of the company being copied stay the same, and the values are copied to the tables of the new company.
  - Synchronizing the table schema with the application.

- Also note that audit fields can't be imported with configuration packages.

## Working in AL

As a developer, the audit fields gives you an easy and performant way to program against historical data. For example, you could write AL queries that return changed data since a specific point in time. For example: 

  - If a record is copied into a temporary table, the audit field values are copied as well. The values aren't changed by the server when calling modify or insert.â€¯ 
  - It is possible to use audit fields in a key. The BC Platform will not auto-index anything.
