# Table Object

Tables are the core objects used to store data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. Regardless of how data is registered in the product - from a web service to a finger swipe on the phone app, the results of that transaction will be recorded in a table. 

The structure of a table has four sections. The first block contains metadata for the overall table; the table type. The fields section describes the data elements that make up the table; their name and the type of data they can store. The keys section contains the definitions of the keys that the table needs to support. The final section details the triggers and code that can run on the table.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Only tables with the [Extensible Property](properties/devenv-extensible-property.md) set to **true** can be extended.

> [!NOTE]  
> Extension objects can have a name with a maximum length of 30 characters.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> System and virtual tables cannot be extended. System tables are created in the ID range of 2.000.000.000 and above. For more information about object ranges, see [Object Ranges](devenv-object-ranges.md).

## Snippet support
Typing the shortcut `ttable` will create the basic layout for a table object when using the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] in Visual Studio Code.


[!INCLUDE[intelli_shortcut](includes/intelli_shortcut.md)]

## Table example

This table stores address information and it has four fields; `Address`, `Locality`, `Town/City`, and `County`.

```
table 50104 Address
{
    Caption = 'Sample table';
    DataPerCompany = true;

    fields
    {
        field(1; Address; Text[50])
        {
            Description = 'Address retrieved by Service';
        }
        field(2; Locality; Text[30])
        {
            Description = 'Locality retrieved by Service';
        }
        field(3; "Town/City"; Text[30])
        {
            Description = 'Town/City retrieved by Service';
        }
        field(4; County; Text[30])
        {
            Description = 'County retrieved by Service';

            trigger OnValidate();
            begin
                ValidateCounty(County);
            end;

        }
    }
    keys
    {
        key(PrimaryKey; Address)
        {
            Clustered = TRUE;
        }
    }

    var
        Msg: Label 'Hello from my method';

    trigger OnInsert();
    begin

    end;

    procedure MyMethod();
    begin
        Message(Msg);
    end;
}
```

## System fields

System fields are fields that are automatically included in every table object by the platform.

System fields are assigned numbers in the range 2000000000-2147483647. This range is reserved for system fields. You will get an design-time error if you give a field a number in this range.

### <a name="systemid"></a>SystemId field

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2](../includes/2019_releasewave2.md)]

The **SystemId** field is a GUID data type field that specifies a unique, immutable (read-only) identifier for records in the table. The **SystemId** field has the following characteristics and behavior:

- All records must have a value in the **SystemId** field.
- You can assign your own value when a record is inserted in the database; otherwise the platform will automatically generate and assign a value.
- Once the **SystemId** has been set, it cannot be changed.
- There is always a unique secondary key on the **SystemId** field to ensure records do not have identical field values.
- The **SystemId** field is given the field number 2000000000.

The **SystemId** field is exposed in the platform code and for AL code, allowing you to code against it. For example:

- The [Insert(Boolean, Boolean)](methods-auto/record/record-insert-boolean-boolean-method.md) lets you specify the **SystemId** value for a record, instead of using one assigned by the platform:

    ```
    myRec.SystemId := '{B6666666-F5A2-E911-8180-001DD8B7338E}';  
    myRec.Insert(true, true);
    ```

- The [GetBySystemId(Guid)](methods-auto/record/record-getbysystemid-method.md) uses the **SystemId** to get a record:

    ```
    id := myRec.GetBySystemId('{B6666666-F5A2-E911-8180-001DD8B7338E}';  
    ```

- The [SystemIdNo()](methods-auto/recordref/recordref-systemidno-method.md) gets the field number used by the **SystemId** field in the table:

    ```
    myRec.OPEN(DATABASE::MyTable);
    SystemIdFieldNo := myRec.SystemIdNo();
    ```
- The [TableRelation](properties/devenv-tablerelation-property.md) lets you use the **SystemId** field to set up table relationships:

    ```
    field(1; MyField; Guid)
    {
        DataClassification = ToBeClassified;
        TableRelation = Customer.SystemId;
    }
    ```

- The **SystemId** field can be used as a binding key to an API:

    ```
    page 50100 "Customer Entity"
    {
        PageType = API;
        ApplicationArea = All;
        UsageCategory = Administration;
        SourceTable = Customer;
        ODataKeyFields = SystemId;
        ...
    ```

### Data Audit Fields in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)]

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2](../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

Every table in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] includes the following four system fields, which can be used for auditing records:

- SystemCreatedAt

   Specifies the data and time that the record was created
- SystemCreatedBy

  Specifies security ID (SID) of the user that created the record 
- SystemLastModifiedAt

  Specifies the data and time that the record was last modified.
- SystemLastModifiedBy

  Specifies the SID of the user that last modified the record

Data audit fields are automatically added by the platform. The platform also exposes the fields in AL code, allowing developers to code against them.

#### Static characteristics

The data audit fields have the following static characteristics:

|Field name (in AL) |Column name (in database)|Data type|Field number|
|----------------|----------------------|--------|------------|
|SystemCreatedAt|$SystemCreatedAt |DateTime|2000000001|
|SystemCreatedBy  |$SystemCreatedBy |GUID |2000000002|
|SystemLastModifiedAt|$SystemLastModifiedAt |DateTime|2000000003|
|SystemLastModifiedBy|$SystemLastModifiedBy |GUID|2000000004|

#### Runtime characteristics

At runtime, the data audit fields have the following characteristics and behavior: 

-  The platform will automatically generate and assign values on the following  

   - After all  [OnBeforeInsert](triggers/devenv-onbeforeinsert-trigger.md) and [OnBeforeModify](triggers/devenv-onbeforemodify-trigger.md) triggers are run
   - After the [OnInsert](triggers/devenv-oninsert-trigger.md) and [OnModify](triggers/devenv-onmodify-trigger.md) triggers are run.
   - Before all [OnAfterInsert](triggers/devenv-onafterinsert-trigger.md) and [OnAfterModify](triggers/devenv-onaftermodify-trigger.md) triggers are run.

    You can't assign your own values to any of the audit fields.

- When a new record is created, before calling Insert, the audit fields are given blank GUIDs and blank dates as values.

- When a record is first inserted, the fields are populated with actual values.

    The SystemCreatedBy and SystemLastModifiedBy fields are given the same value. So are the SystemCreatedAt and SystemLastModifiedAt fields.

    The SystemCreatedBy and SystemCreatedAt won't change after this point.

- When a record is updated, the SystemLastModifiedBy and SystemLastModifiedAt fields are changed.

- The following operations won't change the values of audit fields:

  - Copy company. The values in the tables of the company being copied stay the same, and the values are copied to the tables of the new company.
  - Synchronizing the table schema with the application.

- Audit fields can't be imported with configuration packages.

#### In AL 

As a developer, the audit fields give you an easy and performant way to program against historical data. For example, you could write AL queries that return  data since a specific point in time. For example:

- If a record is copied into a temporary table, the audit field values are copied as well. The values aren't changed by the server when calling modify or insert.â€¯ 
- It's possible to use audit fields in a key. The platform won't auto-index anything.


### <a name="timestamp"></a> Timestamp field

The **timestamp** field contains row version numbers for records, as maintained in SQL Server. The **timestamp** field is hidden, but you can expose it by using [SqlTimestamp Property](properties/devenv-sqltimestamp-property.md), and then write code against it, add filters, and so on, similar to any other field in a table. However, you cannot write to the **timestamp** field.  
  
A typical use of the **timestamp** field is for synchronizing data changes in tables, when you want to identify records that have changed since the last synchronization. For example, you can read all the records in a table, and then store the highest **timestamp** value. Later, you can query and retrieve records that have a higher **timestamp** value than the stored value.  
  
#### Expose the timestamp field  
 
1. Add a field that has the data type `BigInteger`.
  
     Specify a name for the field, such as `Record Time Stamp`. You can specify any valid name for field, but you cannot use `timestamp` because this is a reserved name.  
  
2.  Set the `SqlTimestamp` property to `true`.

    For example:

    ```
    field(3; "Record Time Stamp"; BigInteger)
    {
        SqlTimestamp = true;
    }

Alternatively, you can use a [FieldRef Data Type](methods-auto/fieldref/fieldref-data-type.md) variable to access the timestamp value of a record, as follows:

1.    Create a [RecordRef Data Type](methods-auto/recordref/recordref-data-type.md) variable that references the record in a table for which you want to retrieve its timestamp.

2.    Use the [Field Method](methods-auto/recordref/recordref-field-method.md) on the **RecordRef** variable to get the **FieldRef** for the field that has the number 0. This field contains the timestamp value.

The following example shows how to retrieve the timestamp value for the first record in the `Customer` table. **RecordRef** and **FieldRef** are [RecordRef Data Type](methods-auto/recordref/recordref-data-type.md) and [FieldRef Data Type](methods-auto/fieldref/fieldref-data-type.md) variables, respectively.

    
```
RecordRef.Open(DATABASE::Customer);
RecordRef.FindFirst();
FieldRef := RecordRef.Field(0);
Message(Format(FieldRef.Value()));
```
