# Marketing Checklist for Showcasing Your App

We have created a checklists with guidelines that will help you to create a compelling storefront on AppSource. In these guidelines, you will find an outline of our requirements for marketing validation as well as examples of best practices, which you can use as inspiration, while developing the storefront details of your offer, your sales landing page and video materials. The storefront details on AppSource is the first impression that prospects get regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due diligence when developing this content.

### <a name="LanguageBranding"></a>Language & Branding Requirements 

> [!NOTE]  
> Your App must be in English.

LANGUAGE 
- English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the validation process and create a uniform user experience.
- For you, this means that both the storefront details of your App and everything that is accessible through it must be in English too. Note: This includes: your app's landing page, videos, documentation - such as learn more documents, factsheets, setup instructions, privacy policies, SLA's etc. - as well as help, support and contact options. 

BRANDING
- Be consistent with the branding throughout your communication. Based on the new branding guidelines, product name needs to be listed by the full name **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** at first mention on the page and at all prominent locations such as titles, headings, etc. - Subsequent mentions can drop Microsoft and simply just reference **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. 

> [!NOTE]  
> All content, videos, screenshots etc. must list the product name as **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. These are the ONLY options. Don't use acroynms, shorten the name or abbreviate it or use old product names. Always use the most current version of Dynamics 365 Business Central in screenshots, videos etc. Not permitted ~~BC~~, ~~Business Central~~, ~~D365~~ or any other variation that is NOT **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. 
 

### <a name="OfferSummary"></a>Offer Name and Offer Summary

- **Offer Name** There are many things to consider when creating a relavant and enticing name for your offer. Ideally, your app name should communicate the core value customers will receive and it should not be tied to a specific product. Click on the tab below for more details around Offer Name.

- **Offer Summary** This is the first paragraph that the prospect reads, as it will appear on your app's search page. Hence, make sure that it is clear and concise. Click on the tab below for more details around Offer Summary.

### <a name="OfferDescription"></a>Offer Description 

- **Offer Description** This description will appear on AppSource, just below your Offer Summary. When describing your solution, do not focus on the underlying technology or operational features. Prospects can learn about the details later. Your primary objective is conversion, which means motivating prospects into action. The optimal approach is to remind them of the pain they are likely experiencing and reference the benefits they will experience once they start using your solution. Clearly articulate a compelling desired outcome and result. We recommend you to add a link to your app landing page at the end of your description. Maximum allowed is 1300 characters.

- Make an elaborate and compelling description that outlines the benefits and usage scenarios of your Dynamics 365 Business Central App. It's required and strongly recommended to have the following 6 paragraphs to showcase your App in the best light posssible. 

How to structure the paragraphs in your description:

- Introduction paragraph
- Pain based paragraph
- Benefit based paragraph
- Closing Call to Action paragraph
- Supported Editions paragraph
- Supported Countries paragraph

> [!TIP]  
> By including all of these paragraphs you will provide prospects with a compelling offer that explains to them WHY they need to take action and use it. 

How to format your description in the Cloud Partner Portal?

The right formatting enables prospects to get a quick overview of the value that your offer can give them. Making the description compelling and nice to look at is therefore of key importance. 

When formatting the description of your offer please consider the following:  

- The description can max. be 3000 characters incl. spaces.
- Use simple html tags when formatting your description to create structured sections that are easy to get an overview of. 
- The following html tags are allowed: 
p, em, ul, li, ol and header tags
- Structure your description as small “easily readable” sections with headlines.
- List vital benefits as bullet points  
- Engage prospects by speaking directly to them using second person “you” language. 

**Introduction Paragraph** To capture (and keep) the interest of the prospects you need to create interest and positive mental acknowledgement from the start. This can be achieved by asking relevant provocative questions that prospects either do not know the answer to or can relate to in the introduction paragraph.

**How to structure the content in this paragraph?**
- Make a section where you ask proactive questions. 
- Speak to a core pain they are likely experiencing that has a negative measurable impact.
- The question should stimulate a strong emotional response.  
**How to format this paragraph?**
- Format this section as *a headline in itallic*. 
- Use these html tags: `<h2><em>` section with provocative questions `</em></h2>` 

Example: Do you have the right stock on your shelves? Are stock outs costing you customers? And are your procurement decisions relying on basic spreadsheets? 

**Pain Paragraph** Pain is the most compelling motivator of driving prospects to take action. Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that you communicate WHY your prospects need your product through a “pain-based” paragraph that call out the fears that they are facing. 

**How to structure the content in this paragraph?**
- Use this paragraph to clearly demonstrate to your prospects that you genuinely understand their industry and unique business problems. 
- Describe the business challenges they are facing now (pain) and the ways their revenue growth, margins, productivity (desire), and so on are being negatively impacted by not taking action now.   
- Most importantly, call out the fears that are likely holding them back.
- Remind them of the cost (higher risk, lower margins, lost sales) they are experiencing by putting off a decision. In so doing you have a bigger likelyhood of getting the messages through to them and enticing them to take action. 

**How to format this paragraph**
- Format this section as a paragraph 
- Use these html tags: `<p>` pain paragraph`</p>` 

Example: Managing inventory is a delicate balancing act. Carry too little and you lose orders (and customers). Carry too much and you tie up much needed working capital. Carry far too much and you end up discounting, or worse, writing off obsolete products.  

**Benefit Paragraph** Likewise, you should also make a paragraph that describes the most important benefits and rewards that your prospects will realize by using your offer.  

**How to structure the content in this paragraph?**

- Tell them what they will gain by using your offer  
- You do not need to tell them how you do it, just what they will gain.
- When describing the potential value in specific, measurable business terms ayou will appeal to both their desire and greed. 
- Quantify impacts and gains.  
- The more specific and concrete your promise of value is, the better. Abstract concepts such as “more efficiency, more productivity, transform your business” are not emotionally impactful or convincing, and they do not compel a prospect to act. Paint a picture of a possible experience that the prospect will immediately desire. 
- Avoid the temptation of simply listing features and app functionality. 
- If you make strong claims in the benefit paragraph, make sure you support them with proof.  

**How to format this paragraph**

- Format this section as a paragraph 
- Use these html tags: 
`<p>` 1st benefit paragraph`</p>` 
`<p>` 2nd benefit paragraph`</p>` 

> [!EXAMPLE]  
Our app uses Cortana Intelligence to analyze historical data to predict future demand, so you can base procurement decisions on accurate and reliable forecasts, and help your company avoid lost revenue, optimize shipping costs, discover trends and boost your brand reputation by always delivering on orders. 

Stop relying on basic spreadsheets that take hours of valuable time to complete. Turn anxiety into proactive control and manage this critical business process in minutes by using Microsoft’s Sales and Inventory Forecast extension. 

**Benefits as Bullet Points Paragraph** Round off your description with a strong “Closing Call to action” paragraph that urges customers to take action in order to realize your offer’s benefits.  

- Choose the type of Call to action that you want to include:
- Calls to actions are active directions to your offer’s Landing page, a link to a button at the storefront details and/or a “learn more” document.
- We recommend that you link to both a button and your offer’s unique app landing page in the closing call to action. 

**How to structure the content in this paragraph?**
- We recommend that this paragraph is less than 200 words or 1,200 characters. 
- Insert your chosen call to action(s). 
- Highlight the action that you want users to take by formatting the wanted action in bold as well as linking to your app’s unique landing page (either through hyperlinking the landing page or including a sentence on “Learn more about us here  _www._

**How to format this paragraph**
- Format this section as a paragraph 
- Use these html tags: 
`<p>`Click the `<strong>`Get it now`</strong>` button –  then insert your closing call to action paragraph here`</p>` 

> [!Example]  
Click Get it now and start aligning your inventory replenishment with your customer demand like a pro. Your customers and sales team will love you for it.  

**Supported Editions** Finally, insert a section in the bottom of your description that clearly states which edition(s) your offer supports (Essentials or Premium edition). 

**How to structure the content in this paragraph?**
- Create a header 3 in the html tags and make it bold.  
- Call the header “Supported editions”. 
- Include a sentence that lists the edition(s) that your app supports. 

**How to format this paragraph**
-Format headline in bold 
- Use these html tags: 
`<h3><strong>`Supported editions:`</strong></h3>` 
- Format the paragraph 
- Use these html tags: 
`<p>`This app supports both the Essential and Premium editions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.`</p>` 
`<p>` 

> [!Example]  
> **Supported editions: ** This app supports both the Essential and Premium edition of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

**Supported Countries** Finally, insert a section in the bottom of your description that clearly states which countries your app is available in based on the current list of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Supported Countries found here and listed below https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations 

- Current availability of Dynamics 365 Business Central 
- Available in 19 countries: 
- EMEA (14): AT, BE, CH, DE, DK, ES, FI, FR, IS, IT, NL, NO, SE, UK 
- NA (2): CA, US 
- LATAM (1) MX 
- APAC (2): AU, NZ 

**How to structure the content in this paragraph?**
- Create a header 3 in the html tags and make it bold.  
- Call the header “Supported countries”. 
- Include a sentence that lists the countries that your app is available in. 

> [!Example] 
> **Supported Countries: ** This app is available in: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. 

> [!NOTE]  
> High fail rate on listing **Supported Editions** and **Supported Countries** at the end of the description which will potentially cause you to fail in 4 segments of the Marketing Validation process. This is an example of best practice. 

```
	<h2>Supported Editions</h2>
	<p>This app supports the Essential and Premium editions of Dynamics 365 Business Central</p>
	 
	<h2>Supported Countries</h2>
	<p>List supported countries here, for example ‘Canada, Denmark, and France’</p>
```

Structure 
- Your logo should be designed and optimized for a digital medium, not a traditional print based logo.  
- Monitors emit light and paper absorbs light.  
- Make sure you change the format, as you don’t want to end up with weird, inaccurate color representation. 
- Color calibration across devices can affect the look and feel of your app: 
- All colors can be achieved by merging RGB (red, green, and blue) light, but monitors display only a limited range of the visible spectrum at a low-medium resolution, usually 72-75 dots per inch.  
- Print production usually requires a four-color process CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) in high resolution of at least 300 dpi. 

VIDEOS
Pictures tell more than a 100 words – make sure to leverage this when promoting your offer. 
- Formatting and General requirements to keep in mind when creating videos: 
- A minimum of one video is recommended (up to a maximum of 5 are permitted). 
- Language in videos can be either local or English 

> [!NOTE]

- Don’t make references to acronyms, old Dynamics 365 brand names/logos or demo old UIs. 
- Don’t include logos or trademarks in your video.
