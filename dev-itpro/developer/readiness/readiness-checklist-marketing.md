# Marketing Checklist for Showcasing Your App

We have created a checklists with guidelines that will help you to create a compelling storefront on AppSource. In these guidelines, you will find an outline of our requirements for marketing validation as well as examples of best practices, which you can use as inspiration, while developing the storefront details of your offer, your sales landing page and video materials. The storefront details on AppSource is the first impression that prospects get regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due diligence when developing this content.

### Language & Branding Requirements 

> [!NOTE]  
> Your App must be in English.

LANGUAGE 
- English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the validation process and create a uniform user experience.
- For you, this means that both the storefront details of your App and everything that is accessible through it must be in English too. Note: This includes: your app's landing page, videos, documentation - such as learn more documents, factsheets, setup instructions, privacy policies, SLA's etc. - as well as help, support and contact options. 

BRANDING
- Be consistent with the branding throughout your communication. Based on the new branding guidelines, product name needs to be listed by the full name Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central at first mention on the page and at all prominent locations such as titles, headings, etc. - Subsequent mentions can drop Microsoft and simply just reference Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

> [!NOTE] The use of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is prohibited. Don't use acroynms, old product names. Always use the most current version of Dynamics 365 Business Central in screenshots, videos etc. 

### Offer Name & Summary 
- There are many things to consider when creating a relavant and enticing name for your offer. Ideally, your app name should communicate the core value customers will receive and it should not be tied to a specific product. Click on the tab below for more details around Offer Name.

- The Offer Summary is the first paragraph that the prospect reads, as it will appear on your app's search page. Hence, make sure that it is clear and concise. Click on the tab below for more details around Offer Summary.

### Offer Description 

>Make an elaborate and compelling description that outlines the benefits and usage scenarios of your Dynamics 365 Business Central App. It's required and strongly recommended to have the following 6 paragraphs to showcase your App in the best light posssible. 

How to structure the paragraphs in your description:
- Introduction paragraph
- Pain based paragraph
- Benefit based paragraph
- Closing Call to Action paragraph
- Supported Editions paragraph
- Supported Countries paragraph

> [!NOTE] High fail rate on listing Supported Editions and Supported Countries to the end of the description which will cause you to fail in 4 segments of the Marketing Validation process. This is an example of best practice. 

	<h2>Supported Editions</h2>
	<p>This app supports the Essential and Premium editions of Dynamics 365 Business Central</p>
	 
	<h2>Supported Countries</h2>
	<p>List supported countries here, for example ‘Canada, Denmark, and France’</p>
