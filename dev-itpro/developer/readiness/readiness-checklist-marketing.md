# Why marketing validation is mandatory

The marketing validation is in place to make sure that the customer journey on
AppSource is a uniform experience, where customers quickly and easily can get an
overview of your offer’s functionality, why they can benefit from using it,
while also enticing them to learn more and take the necessary actions to start
using your offer. Accordingly, to ensure that your listing establishes a good
first impression, we carry out a marketing validation of all Dynamics 365 Business Central
apps that are being published on AppSource. This also goes for apps that already
are live, if some of the content in their storefront details needs to be edited
– in this case they need to be resubmitted for marketing validation as well.
Consequently, to be published on AppSource all listings need to pass the
marketing validation.

## Marketing Checklist for Showcasing Your App

We have created a checklist with guidelines that will help you to create a
compelling storefront on AppSource. In these guidelines, you will find an
outline of our requirements for marketing validation as well as examples of best
practices, which you can use as inspiration, while developing the storefront
details of your offer, your sales landing page and video materials. The
storefront details on AppSource is the first impression that prospects get
regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time
in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from
the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when
developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking
elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due
diligence when developing this content.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use this Key to develop your app page according to the in depth information shared below: SALES & INVENTORY FORECAST


To ease your experience with developing the store front details of your listing, we have numerated the core elements, as they appear when you upload it in “Storefront Details” tab at the Cloud Partner Portal.  

The image below is an example of what an offering looks like on AppSource, when the storefront details are completed according to best practices. We highly recommend that you review these guidelines.

## <a name="LanguageBranding"></a>Language & Branding Requirements 

| General requirements      | Description                 | Requirements |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 0.A **Language requirements** | Your app must be in English | Required     |
- English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the validation process and create a uniform user experience. 
- For you, this means that both the storefront details of your app, and everything that is accessible through it must be in English too. 
- This includes: your app’s landing page, videos, documentation – such as “Learn more” documents, factsheets, set up instructions, privacy policies, SLAs etc. – as well as help, support- and contact options. 

NOTE: If your app caters to a local language that isn’t English, you can improve the user experience by: 
- Creating a website that has two landing pages (i.e. two language buttons – cf. one in English and one in the given local language). In so doing your customers can switch to the language they master and thus easily be able to find the right docs and contact info.
- However, this set up implies that you need to *make two versions of all your docs, support options and landing pages.*  
- Note, as mentioned above, everything that is accessible through the Cloud Partner Portal needs to be in English. 

| General requirements                                          | Description                                                     | Requirements |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 0.B **Branding** (How to reference the Microsoft brand correctly) | Be consistent with the branding throughout your communications: Throughout all your sales, communication and marketing materials, all references (spoken and written in videos, docs, app landing page, screenshots, title bars etc.) must refer to the correct branding and UI, cf. either **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.  | Required     |


Make sure to make the right reference throughout your content:
- Based on the new branding guidelines, the full name, **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**, must be used in its entirety at first mention on the page, and at all prominent locations such as titles, headings etc.
- Subsequent mentions can drop "Microsoft" and simply just reference **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. 

Please reference [Microsoft Dynamics 365 branding rules documentation](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2858&topicid=44517 ).
- Don’t include Microsoft names, logos or trademarks in your offer
- Don’t use Dynamics 365 names, logos or trademarks in your offering’s: name, URL, your company name, your social media account names or any other names you might use.
- Don’t make references to acronyms, old brand names or demo old UIs

Don’t make any references in any text, screenshots, title bars, Webclient, spoken language in videos, documentation, app landing pages etc. to:
- Acronyms: “NAV”, “FOBE” or “D365” 
- Old brands: “for financials”, “for Finance & Operations” 
- Screenshots and demos of old Dynamics 365 UIs

Referencing above acronyms, old brand names and old UIs will make your app fail marketing validation promptly.

> [!NOTE]  
> All content, videos, screenshots etc. must list the product name as **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. These are the ONLY options. Don't use acroynms, shorten the name or abbreviate it or use old product names. Always use the most current version of Dynamics 365 Business Central in screenshots, videos etc. Not permitted BC, D365 or any other variation that is NOT **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.

## <a name="OfferName"></a>Offer Name 

| General requirements | Description |Requirements |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0.C **Offer Name**   | Your offers name on AppSource | Required      |

> [!NOTE]  
> The offer name must be the same as the name you specified in the app manifest.

**What your offer name will look like on AppSource** (Applicable naming structures) 
When creating a name for your offer, you can use the following two naming structures:
- Name 1: (Your offer name) for Microsoft Dynamics 365 *Example: Sales & Inventory Forecast for Microsoft Dynamics 365* 
- Name 2: Your offer name only *Example: Sales & Inventory Forecast* | 


| General requirements | Description | Requirements | 
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| 0.D **Offer Name** | There are many things to consider when creating a relevant and enticing name for your offer.  | Recommended |

**How to create a strong app name for your offer** (Do’s and don’ts)?
How to create a good offer name

**Do’s**
- Ideally, your app name should communicate the core value customers will receive and it should not be tied to a specific product 
- Benefit-based names are always more effective than descriptive names. | 
- Use industry specific vocabulary or benefit-based references in your product name if possible – this will increase relevance and conversion rates.

**Don't**
- Don’t use technology specific messaging as your core product name component.
- Avoid using acronyms that are emotionally meaningless.
- Don’t include Microsoft names and/or trademarks, such as Dynamics or Dynamics 365 in your offering names, URLs, company names, social media account names or any other names you might use.

*Key questions to ask yourself when choosing a name for your offer:* 
- Does my product name convey anything to my prospect? 
- Does it capture the essence of the product and the value it delivers?
- Is it appropriate and appealing to our target audience? Is it short?
- Does the name connect with what our business is about?
- Is it interesting and memorable?
- Does it limit us in any way? How easily will it translate into other languages/cultures?
- Is it too much like another product and will it cause market confusion?

![Storefront Detail - Offer Name](../../media/OfferName.png)

## <a name="OfferSummary"></a>Offer Summary

| Offer Details  | Description | Requirements |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1. **Offer Summary**  | The summary is the first paragraph that the prospect reads, as it will appear on your app's search page. Hence, make sure that it is clear and concise. | Required |

How to create a good summary for your offer? 
**How to structure your summary?**
- The summary should be max. 25 words or 100 characters including spaces, or less.
- The summary should summarize the value proposition of your offer in one short and concise sentence.
- The value proposition is a statement of the unique benefits your product delivers to the customer. 

If you need help formulating a positioning statement, try the value proposition generator located [here.](http://neuralimpact.ca/valueproposition)
- Consider whether or not is relevant (or valuable) to include your offer name in the summary 
- Don’t just state the offer name as an attempt to make it more memorable (names rarely give away any clues to the prospect about the value they will receive by starting to use your offer).

> [!Tip]  
> *Example:* *Use reliable forecasting to help ensure that you always have the items your
customers want.*

![Storefront Detail - Offer Summary](../../media/OfferSummary.png)

## <a name="OfferDescription"></a>Offer Description 

| Offer Details  | Description| Requirements |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| 2. **Offer Description** (How to format and structure paragraphs in your offer description) | Make an elaborate and compelling description that outlines the benefits and usage scenarios of your Dynamics 365 Business Central app. | 	Required | 

How to structure the paragraphs in your description? Describe WHY customers would need your product and the value they get from using it instead of just writing WHAT your product does. 

To do so, your description should consist of 6 paragraphs (in the following order):
- Introduction paragraph (point 3.A)
- Pain based paragraph (point 3.B)
- Benefit based paragraph (point 3.C)
- Benefits in bullet points paragraph (3.D)
- Closing Call to action paragraph (point 3.E)
- Supported editions paragraph (point 3.F)
- Supported countries paragraph (point 3.G)

By including all of these paragraphs you will provide prospects with a compelling offer that explains them WHY they need to start using it.

How to format your description in the Cloud Partner Portal? The right formatting enables prospects to get a quick overview of the value that your offer can give them. Making the description compelling and nice to look at is therefore of key importance. 

When formatting the description of your offer please consider the following:
- The description can max. be 3000 characters incl. spaces
- Use simple html tags when formatting your description to create structured sections that are easy to get an overview of. 

The following html tags are allowed:
- p, em, ul, li, ol and header tags.
- Structure your description as small “easily readable” sections with headlines
- List vital benefits as bullet points
- Engage prospects by speaking directly to them using second person “you” language.

| Offer Details  | Description | Requirements |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2.A Offer Description **(Introduction Paragraph)** | To capture (and keep) the interest of the prospects you need to create interest and positive mental acknowledgement from the start. This can be achieved by asking relevant provocative questions that prospects either do not know the answer to or can relate to in the introduction paragraph. | Recommended  |

How to structure the content in this paragraph?
- Make a section where you ask provocative questions. 
- Speak to a core pain they are likely experiencing that has a negative measurable impact
- The question should stimulate a strong emotional response.

How to format this paragraph?
- Format this section as a headline *in itallic.*

Use these html tags:
- \<h2\>\<em\> section with provocative questions
- \</em\>\</h2\>

> [!TIP]  
> *Example:* *Do you have the right stock on your shelves? Are stock outs costing you customers? And are your procurement decisions relying on basic spreadsheets?*

| Offer Details | Description | Requirements |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2.B Offer Description **(Pain paragraph)** | Pain is the most compelling motivator of driving prospects to take action. Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that you communicate WHY your prospects need your product through a “pain-based” paragraph that call out the fears that they are facing. | Recommended  |

How to structure the content in this paragraph?
- Use this paragraph to clearly demonstrate to your prospects that you genuinely understand their industry and unique business problems.
- Describe the business challenges they are facing now (pain) and the ways their revenue growth, margins, productivity (desire), and so on are being negatively impacted by not taking action now.
- Most importantly, call out the fears that are likely holding them back.
- Remind them of the cost (higher risk, lower margins, lost sales) they are experiencing by putting off a decision. In so doing you have a bigger likelihood of getting the messages through to them and enticing them to take action.

How to format this paragraph? Format this section as a paragraph
- Use these html tags: \<p\> pain paragraph\</p\> 

*Example:*

> [!TIP]  
> *Example:* *Managing inventory is a delicate balancing act. Carry too little and you
lose orders (and customers). Carry too much and you tie up much needed working capital. Carry far too much and you end up discounting, or worse, writing off obsolete products.*

| Offer Details  | Description | Requirements |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2.C Offer Description **(Benefit paragraph)** | Likewise, you should also make a paragraph that describes the most important benefits and rewards that your prospects will realize by using your offer. | Recommended  |

How to structure the content in this paragraph?
- Tell them what they will gain by using your offer 
- You do not need to tell them how you do it, just what they will gain.
- When describing the potential value in specific, measurable business terms, you will appeal to both their desire and greed.

Quantify impacts and gains. 
- The more specific and concrete your promise of value is, the better. Abstract concepts such as “more efficiency, more productivity, transform your business” are not emotionally impactful or convincing, and they do not compel a prospect to act. Paint a picture of a possible experience that the prospect will immediately desire.
- Avoid the temptation of simply listing features and app functionality.
- If you make strong claims in the benefit paragraph, make sure you support them with proof.

How to format this paragraph?*
Format this section as a paragraph 

Use these html tags:
- \<p\> 1st benefit paragraph\</p\>
- \<p\> 2nd benefit paragraph\</p\>

> [!TIP]  
> *Example:* *Our app uses Cortana Intelligence to analyze historical data to predict
future demand, so you can base procurement decisions on accurate and
reliable forecasts, and help your company avoid lost revenue, optimize
shipping costs, discover trends and boost your brand reputation by always
delivering on orders.*
*Stop relying on basic spreadsheets that take hours of valuable time to
complete. Turn anxiety into proactive control and manage this critical
business process in minutes by using Microsoft’s Sales and Inventory
Forecast extension.*

|----------------|------------|--------------|
| 2.E Offer Description **(Closing Call to action paragraph)** | Round off your description with a strong “Closing Call to action” paragraph that urges customers to take action in order to realize your offer’s benefits. | Recommended  |

- Calls to actions are active directions to your offer’s: Landing page, a link to a button at the storefront details and/or a “learn more” document

| 14.A Offer logo for your app’s search page (.png, 48x48 pixels)    | 1 offer logo for your app’s search page: 48x48 pixels resolution .png image [./media/image17.jpg](./media/image17.jpg) | Required     |

You are required to provide two offer logos on AppSource:
- one in 48x48 pixels resolution for your app’s search page:
- one in 216x216 pixels resolution for your app’s details page:
- Both logos needs to be uploaded as .png images

![Storefront Detail - Offer Logo](../../media/OfferLogo.png)

Structure
- Your logo should be designed and optimized for a digital medium, not a traditional print based logo.
- Monitors emit light and paper absorbs light.
- Make sure you change the format, as you don’t want to end up with weird, inaccurate color representation.
- Color calibration across devices can affect the look and feel of your app:
- All colors can be achieved by merging RGB (red, green, and blue) light, but monitors display only a limited range of the visible spectrum at a lowmedium resolution, usually 72-75 dots per inch. 
- Print production usually requires a four-color process CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) in high resolution of at least 300 dpi.

| Marketing artifacts                  | Description                                                                                 | Requirements |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 15. **Videos**          | Pictures tell more than a 100 words – make sure to leverage this when promoting your offer. | Recommended  |

Large amounts of information are easier to take in when visualized. Using videos that demo your offer are therefore ideal to create intertest and enable prospects to learn more about your offer quickly. On AppSource videos will play when customers select the associated video thumbnail on your app's details page.

Formatting and General requirements (cf. section 0.A-D) to keep in mind when creating videos:
- A minimum of one video is recommended (up to a maximum of 5 are permitted).
- Language in videos can be either local or English
- Note, videos made in local language must have subtitles in English.
Make the right references from the get go: 
- Only include screenshots & demo of the newest UI.
- Reference Microsoft’s brand names correctly:
- Only refer to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central or Dynamics 365 Business Central.
