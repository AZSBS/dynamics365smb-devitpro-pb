# Why marketing validation is mandatory

The marketing validation is in place to make sure that the customer journey on
AppSource is a uniform experience, where customers quickly and easily can get an
overview of your offer’s functionality, why they can benefit from using it,
while also enticing them to learn more and take the necessary actions to start
using your offer. Accordingly, to ensure that your listing establishes a good
first impression, we carry out a marketing validation of all Business Central
apps that are being published on AppSource. This also goes for apps that already
are live, if some of the content in their storefront details needs to be edited
– in this case they need to be resubmitted for marketing validation as well.
Consequently, to be published on AppSource all listings need to pass the
marketing validation.

## Marketing Checklist for Showcasing Your App

We have created a checklists with guidelines that will help you to create a
compelling storefront on AppSource. In these guidelines, you will find an
outline of our requirements for marketing validation as well as examples of best
practices, which you can use as inspiration, while developing the storefront
details of your offer, your sales landing page and video materials. The
storefront details on AppSource is the first impression that prospects get
regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time
in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from
the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when
developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking
elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due
diligence when developing this content.

### <a name="LanguageBranding"></a>Language & Branding Requirements 

| General requirements      | Description                 | Requirements |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 0.A Language requirements | Your app must be in English | Required     |

- English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the
    validation process and create a uniform user experience.

- For you, this means that both the storefront details of your app, and
    everything that is accessible through it must be in English too.

>   o This includes: your app’s landing page, videos, documentation – such as
>   “Learn more” documents, factsheets, set up instructions, privacy policies,
>   SLAs etc. – as well as help, support- and contact options.

>   If your app caters to a local language that isn’t English, you can improve
>   the user experience by:

- Creating a website that has two landing pages (i.e. two language buttons –
    cf. one in English and one in the given local language). In so doing your
    customers can switch to the language they master and thus easily be able to
    find the right docs and contact info.

- However, this set up implies that you need to *make two versions of all your
    docs,* support options *and landing pages.*

- Note, as mentioned above, everything that is accessible through the Cloud
    Partner Portal needs to be in English.

>   Get inspiration on how to create a user-friendly landing page and (cf. see
>   *“Checklist C”*) how Deex Korea Co Ltd has set up their apps landing page to
>   accommodate two languages, and everything that this entails. You can find
>   their landing pages here: o [Deex Korea Co Ltd (English
>   version)](http://www.deex.co.kr/index_en) o [Deex Korea Co Ltd (Korean
>   version)](http://www.deex.co.kr/)

>   *Example of a user friendly landing page that has two language options and
>   is set up in accordance with our best practices:*

| General requirements                                          | Description                                                     | Requirements |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 0.B Branding (How to reference the Microsoft brand correctly) | Be consistent with the branding throughout your communications: | Required     |

-   Throughout all your sales-, communication- and marketing materials, all
    references (spoken and written in videos, docs, app landing page,
    screenshots, title bars etc.) must refer to the correct branding and UI, cf.
    either Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central or Dynamics 365 Business
    Central.

>   Make sure to make the right reference throughout your content:

-   Based on the new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central branding
    guidelines, the full name, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, must be
    used in its entirety at first mention at a page, and at all prominent
    locations such as titles, headings etc.

-   Subsequent mentions can drop "Microsoft" and simply just reference Dynamics
    365 Business Central. Please reference [Microsoft Dynamics 365 branding
    rules
    documentation](https://mbs.microsoft.com/Files/partner/365/Training/PartnerGuidelinesforusingtheMicrosoftDynamics365Brand.pdf)
    on Microsoft Collaborate.

>   Don’t include Microsoft names, logos or trademarks in your offer

-   Don’t use Dynamics 365 names, logos or trademarks in your offering’s: name,
    URL, your company name, your social media account names or any other names
    you might use.

>   Don’t make references to acronyms, old brand names or demo old UIs

-   *Don’t* make any references in any text, screenshots, title bars, Webclient,
    spoken language in videos, documentation, app landing pages etc. to:

>   o Acronyms: “NAV”, “FOBE” or “D365” o Old brands: “for financials”, “for
>   Finance &

>   Operations” o Screenshots and demos of old Dynamics 365 UIs

>   Referencing above acronyms, old brand names and old UIs will make your app
>   fail marketing validation promptly.

>   [!NOTE]  
>   All content, videos, screenshots etc. must list the product name as
>   **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business
>   Central**. These are the ONLY options. Don't use acroynms, shorten the name
>   or abbreviate it or use old product names. Always use the most current
>   version of Dynamics 365 Business Central in screenshots, videos etc. Not
>   permitted BC, Business Central, D365 or any other variation that is NOT
>   **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business
>   Central**.

|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 0.C                  | *Your offers name on AppSource* | Required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |             |
| 0.D                  | There are                       | many things to consider when creating a relevant and enticing name for your offer. *How to create a strong app name for your offer (Do’s and don’ts)?* Do’s o Ideally, your app name should communicate the core value customers will receive and it should not be tied to a specific product | Recommended |

>   Offer Name

>   Structure

>   (What your offer name will look like on

>   AppSource)

-   The offer name must be the same as the name you specified in the app
    manifest.

>   *Applicable naming structures*

-   When creating a name for your offer, you can use the following two naming
    structures:

>   o Name 1: (Your offer name) for Microsoft Dynamics 365 *Example: Sales &
>   Inventory Forecast for Microsoft*

>   *Dynamics 365* o Name 2: Your offer name only

*Example: Sales & Inventory Forecast*

>   Offer Name

>   (How to create a good offer name)

-   Benefit-based names are always more effective than descriptive names.

-   Use industry specific vocabulary or benefit-based references in your product
    name if possible – this will increase relevance and conversion rates.

Don’ts o Don’t use technology specific messaging as your core product name
component.

-   Avoid using acronyms that are emotionally meaningless.

-   Don’t include Microsoft names and/or trademarks, such as Dynamics or
    Dynamics 365 in your offering names, URLs, company names, social media
    account names or any other names you might use.

*Key questions to ask yourself when choosing a name for your offer:* Does my
product name convey anything to my prospect? Does it capture the essence of the
product and the value it delivers?

Is it appropriate and appealing to our target audience? Is it short?

Does the name connect with what our business is about?

Is it interesting and memorable?

Does it limit us in any way? How easily will it translate into other
languages/cultures?

Is it too much like another product and will it cause market confusion?

#### Offer details

| Offer Details                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                             | Requirements |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1. Offer Summary (How to create a good summary for your offer) | The summary is the first paragraph that the prospect reads, as it will appear on your app's search page. Hence, make sure that it is clear and concise. | Required     |

>   *How to structure your summary?*

-   The summary should be max. 25 words or 100 characters including spaces, or
    less.

-   The summary should summarize the value proposition of your offer in one
    short and concise sentence.

>   o The value proposition is a statement of the unique benefits your product
>   delivers to the customer. o If you need help formulating a positioning
>   statement, try the value proposition generator located
>   [here.](http://neuralimpact.ca/valueproposition)

-   Consider whether or not is relevant (or valuable) to include your offer name
    in the summary o Don’t just state the offer name as an attempt to make it
    more memorable (names rarely give away any clues to the prospect about the
    value they will receive by starting to use your offer).

>   *Example:*

>   *Use reliable forecasting to help ensure that you always have the items your
>   customers want.*

| Offer Details                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Requirements |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 2.A Offer Description (Introduction Paragraph) | To capture (and keep) the interest of the prospects you need to create interest and positive mental acknowledgement from the start. This can be achieved by asking relevant provocative questions that prospects either do not know the answer to or can relate to in the introduction paragraph. | Recommended  |

>   *How to structure the content in this paragraph?*

-   Make a section where you ask provocative questions. o Speak to a core pain
    they are likely experiencing that has a negative measurable impact

>   o The question should stimulate a strong emotional response.

>   *How to format this paragraph?*

-   Format this section as a headline *in itallic.*

-   Use these html tags:

>   \<h2\>\<em\> section with provocative questions

>   \</em\>\</h2\>

>   *Example:*

>   *Do you have the right stock on your shelves? Are stock outs costing you
>   customers? And are your procurement decisions relying on basic
>   spreadsheets?*

| Offer Details                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Requirements |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 2.B Offer Description (Pain paragraph) | Pain is the most compelling motivator of driving prospects to take action. Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that you communicate WHY your prospects need your product through a “pain-based” paragraph that call out the fears that they are facing. | Recommended  |

>   *How to structure the content in this paragraph?*

-   Use this paragraph to clearly demonstrate to your prospects that you
    genuinely understand their industry and unique business problems.

-   Describe the business challenges they are facing now (pain) and the ways
    their revenue growth, margins, productivity (desire), and so on are being
    negatively impacted by not taking action now.

-   Most importantly, call out the fears that are likely holding them back.

-   Remind them of the cost (higher risk, lower margins, lost sales) they are
    experiencing by putting off a decision. In so doing you have a bigger
    likelihood of getting the messages through to them and enticing them to take
    action.

>   *How to format this paragraph?*

-   Format this section as a paragraph o Use these html tags:

>   \<p\> pain paragraph\</p\> *Example:*

>   *Managing inventory is a delicate balancing act. Carry too little and you
>   lose orders (and customers). Carry too much and you tie up much needed
>   working capital. Carry far too much and you end up discounting, or worse,
>   writing off obsolete products.*

| Offer Details                             | Description                                                                                                                                             | Requirements |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 2.C Offer Description (Benefit paragraph) | Likewise, you should also make a paragraph that describes the most important benefits and rewards that your prospects will realize by using your offer. | Recommended  |

>   *How to structure the content in this paragraph?*

-   Tell them what they will gain by using your offer o You do not need to tell
    them how you do it, just what they will gain.

-   When describing the potential value in specific, measurable business terms,
    you will appeal to both their desire and greed.

-   Quantify impacts and gains. o The more specific and concrete your promise of
    value is, the better. Abstract concepts such as “more efficiency, more
    productivity, transform your business” are not emotionally impactful or
    convincing, and they do not compel a prospect to act. Paint a picture of a
    possible experience that the prospect will immediately desire.

-   Avoid the temptation of simply listing features and app functionality.

-   If you make strong claims in the benefit paragraph, make sure you support
    them with proof.

>   *How to format this paragraph?*

-   Format this section as a paragraph o Use these html tags:

>   \<p\> 1st benefit paragraph\</p\>

>   \<p\> 2nd benefit paragraph\</p\>

>   *Example:*

>   *Our app uses Cortana Intelligence to analyze historical data to predict
>   future demand, so you can base procurement decisions on accurate and
>   reliable forecasts, and help your company avoid lost revenue, optimize
>   shipping costs, discover trends and boost your brand reputation by always
>   delivering on orders.*

>   *Stop relying on basic spreadsheets that take hours of valuable time to
>   complete. Turn anxiety into proactive control and manage this critical
>   business process in minutes by using Microsoft’s Sales and Inventory
>   Forecast extension.*

|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 2.E Offer Description (Closing Call to action paragraph) | Round off your description with a strong “Closing Call to action” paragraph that urges customers to take action in order to realize your offer’s benefits. | Recommended  |

    inaccurate color representation.

-   Color calibration across devices can affect the look and feel of your app:

-   All colors can be achieved by merging RGB (red, green, and blue) light, but
    monitors display only a limited range of the visible spectrum at a lowmedium
    resolution, usually 72-75 dots per inch. o Print production usually requires
    a four-color process CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) in high resolution
    of at least 300 dpi.

>   Formatting

-   A minimum of one document is required (up to a maximum of 3 are permitted).

-   It is a requirement that all docs are written in English and are formatted
    as PDF-files.

-   We recommend you to add the link to your app landing page to all your
    documents.

>   Structure

-   Think wisely about what content you include in the learn more section. Don’t
    sell, educate the prospect:

-   Don’t just include a description of your offer here – the prospect has
    already read the description in the store front details in AppSource and has
    shown an interest in your offering by clicking on the learn more item –
    don’t discourage this interest by repeating something that they already
    know. o Instead, use this opportunity to show them something new that
    entices their interest to start using your offer even more.

-   Examples of Sales and marketing docs you can include as your “Learn more”
    assets are:

-   Set up instructions, customer reviews, marketing materials, white papers,
    brochures, check lists, PowerPoints etc.

| 17. Screenshots     | Pictures speak more directly to our brain than words. Your screenshots should therefore clearly demonstrate the claims you make and the functionality of your offer. | Required     |

>   Formatting

-   A minimum of 3 screenshots are required (up to a maximum of 5 are
    permitted).

-   Use images that demos your offer in Dynamics 365 Business Central and if
    possible, what problem your offer is solving.

-   Choose the proper image format to use: o Screen portraits

>   ▪ Can be more effective than screenshots because you can design annotations
>   in them.

-   Screenshots

>   ▪ Require super-imposing, which can be clumsy and confusing. Also,
>   screenshots lose readability when reduced in size

>   Structure

-   Upload only .png images with a resolution on 1280 x 720 px.

-   Examples of different types of images that you can include to visually
    demonstrate claims made are:

-   Infographics, tables, charts, dashboards etc.

Use screenshots that includes realistic demo data and tell a compelling story o
Use visual images that highlights and demonstrates the key competitive
differential between your product and others.

-   Our brains love contrast, so use comparisons if you can (i.e.

>   screenshots of “before” and “after” using your offer).

Choose key visual elements to highlight rather than including a full screen of
distracting, irrelevant content.

-   Graphic dashboards are optimal.

-   Zoom in on differentiation aspects.

-   *Don’t use small fonts*, as small fonts that require squinting.

-   *Don’t include screenshots from the Winclient* – only use screenshots from
    the Webclient and the Dynamics 365 Business Central UI.
