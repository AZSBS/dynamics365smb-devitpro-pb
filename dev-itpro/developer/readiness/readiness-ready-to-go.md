# Ready to Go
The **"Ready to Go"** program is designed to support you in bringing your Microsoft [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] offers into Microsoft Appsource. The program holds the following three core elements:

- The "Ready to Go" online learning
- The "Ready to Go" coaching
- The "Ready to Go" platform

library of training resources for both app developers (ISVs) as well as resellers (VARs). It is a collection of materials for marketeers, business decision makers, sales and presales persons, architects, consultants, and developers.

The "Ready to Go" validation workshop is offered by all Development Centers and Master VARs at fixed price and is designed to coach you in bringing your [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_central_md](../includes/d365_bus_central_md.md)] offerings to market faster and with less friction by providing individual coaching. This 8-hour workshop helps partners make the right decisions and is based upon a unified checklist and set of training materials. The workshop validates and coaches the partner’s readiness on their go-to market business model, marketing plans, architectural plans, app Development and internal readiness.
