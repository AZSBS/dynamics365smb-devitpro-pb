## Language and Branding Guidelines

| General requirements      | Description                 | Requirements |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 0.A **Language requirements** | Your app must be in English | Required     |
- English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the validation process and create a uniform user experience.
- For you, this means that both the storefront details of your app, and everything that is accessible through it must be in English too. 
- This includes: your app’s landing page, videos, documentation – such as “Learn more” documents, factsheets, set up instructions, privacy policies, SLAs etc. – as well as help, support- and contact options. 

NOTE: If your app caters to a local language that isn’t English, you can improve the user experience by: 
- Creating a website that has two landing pages (i.e. two language buttons – cf. one in English and one in the given local language). In so doing your customers can switch to the language they master and thus easily be able to find the right docs and contact info.
- However, this set up implies that you need to *make two versions of all your docs, support options and landing pages.*  
- Note, as mentioned above, everything that is accessible through the Cloud Partner Portal needs to be in English. 

| General requirements                                          | Description                                                     | Requirements |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 0.B **Branding** (How to reference the Microsoft brand correctly) | Be consistent with the branding throughout your communications: Throughout all your sales, communication and marketing materials, all references (spoken and written in videos, docs, app landing page, screenshots, title bars etc.) must refer to the correct branding and UI, cf. either **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.  | Required     |


Make sure to make the right reference throughout your content:
- Based on the ”new” branding guidelines, the full name, "**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**" must be used in its entirety at first mention on the page, and at all prominent locations such as titles, headings etc. (unless the Microsoft brand is already clearly established)
- **Dynamics 365 Business Central** on second mention (or first mention if the Microsoft brand is already clearly established)
- **Business Central** on subsequent mention as long as Microsoft Dynamics 365 has been clearly established on that given page or content. 

Please reference [Microsoft Dynamics 365 branding rules documentation](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2858&topicid=44517 ).
- Don’t include Microsoft names, logos or trademarks in your offer
- Don’t use Dynamics 365 names, logos or trademarks in your offering’s: name, URL, your company name, your social media account names or any other names you might use.
- Don’t make references to acronyms, old brand names or demo old UIs

Don’t make any references in any text, screenshots, title bars, Webclient, spoken language in videos, documentation, app landing pages etc. to:
- Acronyms: “NAV”, “FOBE” or “D365” 
- Old brands: “for financials”, “for Finance & Operations” 
- Screenshots and demos of old Dynamics 365 UIs

Referencing above acronyms, old brand names and old UIs will make your app fail marketing validation promptly.

> [!NOTE]  
> All content, videos, screenshots etc. must list the product name as **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. Only when the two previous mentioned options are established is it appropriate to use **Business Central** by itself. Don't use acroynms, shorten the name or abbreviate it or use old product names. Always use the most current version of Dynamics 365 Business Central in screenshots, videos etc. Not permitted BC, D365 or any other variation. When in doubt, only use **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** or **Dynamics 365 Business Central**. Limit usage of **Business Central** by itself so that the product branding can be clearly defined and consistent throughout content.
