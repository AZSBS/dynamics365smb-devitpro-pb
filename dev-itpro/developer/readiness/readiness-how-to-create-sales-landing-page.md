# Guideline on creating an effective Sales Landing page for your app
## Building a landing page that drives a successful buying transaction

Microsoft will drive qualified traffic to AppSource. Though, once a prospect becomes aware of your app, it will be your job to guide them through to a successful buying transaction. Deliberately mapping and architecting the buying journey is critical to ensure a high level of engagement and conversion. Only presenting your app’s features and functionality, or just providing a free trial, will not ensure prospects will become buyers. For this you need to have a good landing page that is built to help you capture attention, accelerate your customer acquisition process, and drive buying behavior. The recommendations on this page will help you do so.

Your app landing page should be built to move prospects effectively through the following stages:

## Accommodating more languages than English

English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the validation process and create a uniform user experience.

For you, this means that both the storefront details of your app, and everything that is accessible through it must be in English too.
- This includes: your app’s landing page, videos, documentation – such as “Learn more” documents, factsheets, set up instructions, privacy policies, SLAs etc. – as well as help, support- and contact options.

If your app caters to a local language that isn’t English, you can improve the user experience by:
- Creating a website that has two landing pages (i.e. two language buttons – cf. one in English and one in the given local language). In so doing your customers can switch to the language they master and thus easily be able to find the right docs and contact info by a shift of a button.
- However, this set up implies that you need to *make two versions of all your docs, support options and landing pages*.
- Note, as mentioned earlier within the "Marketing Validation Checklist" everything that is accessible through the Cloud Partner Portal needs to be in English.

Below you can see how Deex Korea Co Ltd has set up their apps landing page to accommodate two languages, and everything that this entails. We recommend that you use it as inspiration on how to create a user-friendly landing page. If you click on the pictures you will be re-directed to their two respective landing pages.

Example of Deex Korea Co Ltd.’s user-freindly landing pages that accomodates two language options and is set up in accordance with our best practices:

## Examples of how other partners have implemented our best practices

To inspire you in creating a good landing page for your app, two of our valued partners, LS Retail and Industry Built, have offered to provide a sample of what a best practice landing page for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central partner could look like.

Have a look at their app landing pages and use them as inspiration to build your own landing page:

[Industry Built’s Build Food app](http://www.buildfood.cloud/)
[LS Retail’s LS Express Start app](https://lsexpress.lsretail.com/)

In the following checklist, we have “broken down” the elements, on their landing pages in order to showcase best practices on design and messaging. More specifically, we are looking into layout and structure elements, content elements, visual elements, anxiety reducing elements and support elements.

Additionally, we have provided specific recommendations on how to apply these elements to help you increase conversion and maximize the effectiveness of your product’s sales landing page.

We urge you to review and implement these best practices on your landing page – in so doing you will contribute in providing the Microsoft community of customers with a consistent buying experience across publishers.

## Layout and structure elements
| Element                                | Description | Example |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
|Company|	Include the company logo on the page|	./media/image30.jpg|
|App name & app logo	|Include a visual logo of your product name and a onesentence positioning statement.		|./media/image31.jpg|
|||./media/image32.jpg|
|||./media/image33.jpg|
|Top menu choices|	Use clean, straightforward and descriptive menu options.|	/media/image34.jpg|
|Search box|	Include a search box so visitors can quickly find what they are looking for.|./media/image37.jpg |	
|Emotional tribal anchor photos|	Visuals create an emotional Add-onion. The brain skims over non-emotional photos.|		./media/image38.jpg|
|Visual| Make your page easy to scan, with lots of strong visual imagery.|		./media/image39.jpg

## Logo
- The upper-left corner of the landing page is the most valuable section of the entire landing page.
- Place your company logo in this location.

If you need help formulating a positioning statement, try the value proposition generator located at [here](http://neuralimpact.ca/valueproposition/) 
- There should ideally be 5 or fewer choices; do not include more than 7 options.
- The menu text should state what the prospect gains if they click on the menu item
- The text should be written from their perspective, not yours.

**Recommended menu items:**
- How to Buy, Benefits Gained, Why Us, and Contact.

## The upper-right corner of the page is usually an ideal spot.
- Faces evoke more emotion than landscapes or machines, and so on.
- Include a happy customer that looks similar to your prospect in terms of age, demographic, and industry, and which shows them dealing with the issues that your prospect can relate to.
- Try not to use stock photos of people or objects.

**Engagement**
- Too much text forces the brain to skim, skip, and exit. Text engages the logical, analytical brain, but not the emotional brain.
- Keep it clean and straightforward in terms of design and layout. Use lots of pictures, graphs, and screen shots to enhance engagement.

## Content elements: Text and messaging
| Element                                | Description | Example |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|	
|Include a headline question|	Get your prospects’ attention by asking them a compelling pain-based question that they can relate to.|	“Struggling to manage your ingredient inventory and fretting over allergens?”	|
||You want the prospect to mentally say “YES” as often as possible and to peak their curiosity enough to read more.|
|| Your questions should be intriguing and customer-centric.|
||In general, 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy, but only 2 out of 10 will read the rest.|
|Microsoft Dynamics 365 product description|	Somewhere on the landing page, make sure you include the standard Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central product description provided by Microsoft *This is a requirement because your product is adding value to and building on this foundational solution.*|	*Insert this paragraph:* Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is a comprehensive business management solution for small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) that have outgrown their basic accounting software. From day one, this new application makes ordering, selling, invoicing, and reporting easier and faster. Dynamics 365 Business Central is deeply integrated with Office 365 and includes built-in intelligence, so it is easy to use and helps users make better business decisions.	|	
Messaging (Address their pains)|	Pain is a strong motivator of action. |		./media/image40.jpg| 
||- Identify 1-3 key sources of the client’s most prominent pain early on the page.| ./media/image41.jpg|
||
|| - Call out the fears that are likely to be holding them back.
||- Your landing page text and messaging should predominantly focus on the pain the prospect is experiencing, and NOT the features of your product or service.

Clearly demonstrate to your prospects that you genuinely understand their industry and unique business problems.
- Describe the business challenges they are facing now and the ways their revenue growth, margins, productivity and so on, are being negatively impacted by not taking action now.


| Element                                | Description | Example |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|			
|**Messaging (Product benefits)**|Paint a clear, visual and desirable picture of what is possible. |		./media/image43.jpg|
|||./media/image44.jpg|
|||./media/image46.jpg|
- Describe the most significant benefits and rewards that your prospect will realize after purchase.
    - For example, “Save time and money (benefits) by having a system that does all the tracking and calculations for you (features).”
- Don’t only list features and app functionality, start with the benefit first, then you can follow with the features.
- Paint a picture of a possible experience the prospect will immediately desire.

Clearly articulate a compelling desired outcome
- If possible, use industry-specific language and vocabulary to resonate with your prospect deeply.
- Choose a particular persona to speak to directly.
- Engage prospects by speaking directly to them using first person “you” language.

| Element                                | Description | Example |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|	
|**Messaging (Prove your claims)** |	Include specific calls-to-action on your app page.|		./media/image52.jpg|
Don’t make general and abstract claims.	“Reduce how long it takes to set up your recipes in the morning from 1 hour to 10 minutes.”		
Target market	If you support multiple countries or languages, this is a key selling feature. • Find a way to show this visually.	./media/image49.jpg
	



•	Use data as often as possible to support your statements.
If you make specific claims, support your claims with proof, while Quantifying impacts and gains.
•	The more specific and concrete your promise of value is, the better.
•	Abstract concepts such as “more efficiency, more productivity, transform your business” are not emotionally impactful or convincing and do not compel a prospect to act.

Element	Description	Example		


			./media/image53.jpg

Messaging	Help your prospect gain a sense of urgency to buy by teaching them one thing about how they can be more efficient or profitable now.	Your bakery	./media/image55.jpg

			profitability will decrease over the next five years due to an increase of 3% in the cost of key inputs, such as wheat and sugar. Want to know five key strategies that can help you mitigate this challenge? Click here to find out how to preserve your profit margin	
			./media/image56.jpg

(Compelling call-to-action)
•	This can be your free trial; a time-limited special price; a scheduled walk-through demonstration; and so on.
•	The words "free” and “save” are highly emotional words in the English language, so they should be used.
•	Use bright colors, such as orange, yellow, or red, to call attention to your buttons.
Button text should use benefit language rather than descriptive language.
•	For example, instead of “Download” write
“Click here to start saving money now.”
•	Try not to send prospects away from your page – always have an embedded next step in your call to action that brings them back to your landing page.
(Create a sense of urgency by teaching the prospects)
•	Show them how their performance in one key business area is below that of their competitors.
•	For an example you can provide a quick online self-assessment, a top-10 tips blog post, and much more.
Visual elements
Element	Description	Example		
Pictures	Show the before and after state.	./media/image57.jpg
	
Compelling proof screen shots	Visually demonstrate all the claims that you are making.	Quickly and easily view inventory items		
Videos	Include as many videos as possible.		./media/image61.jpg

				
			./media/image62.jpg

(Differentiation comparison images)
Show them, don’t tell them
•	This is a visual image of how your prospects do things now versus how they will be able to do it in the future.
•	You are not telling them but showing them using a visual.
•	Graphic dashboards are the most effective method.
•	Zoom in on the main benefit-related features.
•	Make sure it is readable, and the benefit is obvious.
•	Include a caption.
•	Data should be industry specific so that it resonates with the viewer.
You want prospects to see how their data/process would look in your system.

(Tell your story using videos not text)
•	Videos have a much higher level of engagement and viewing time and convey much more than you can ever say with words.
Include at least one customer testimonial video on your app landing page.
•	Your client should speak specifically about the pains they had before and the benefits they gained after, not product features. It should be all about your customers, not you.
Include one product demonstration video.
•	See the video best practices in Checklist D.
Elements that reduce anxiety and risk, while increasing trust
Element	Description	Example		
Customer testimonials	Don’t sell your product; let your customers do that for you.		./media/image63.jpg

			./media/image64.jpg

Reduce risk	Prospects are afraid of being scammed and taken advantage of on the internet. They are naturally cautious and highly suspect.		./media/image65.jpg

			Source: Microsoft.com	
Live chat	Include live chat, with a photo of one of your team members smiling at an appropriate time to increase conversion, such as when a prospect clicks the back button on your pricing page. • Include their name if possible to build trust.		./media/image67.jpg

•	Social proof is more credible and trustworthy to prospects. The purpose of testimonials is to reduce the buyer's anxiety and fear.
Your testimonials should answer the following questions:
•	“Will this work for my situation?”
•	“What benefit will I really get if I buy this?”
•	“Is this going to be too hard?” • “How long is this going to take?
•	“Can I trust this company?”
•	You want to convert prospects to buyers.
•	Make it easy for them to buy, while reducing their anxiety.
Transparency is the key to building trust.
•	Make sure that you include a link to a BUY NOW page, which includes full pricing details.
•	Give them a compelling offer they cannot refuse. Offer a time-limited trial or special pricing discount if they buy in 30 days.
•	Use scarcity to compel action. Offer a 100% money-back guarantee.
We recommend providing three offerings, optimized for three different customer segments. For more recommendations on pricing, see the pricing guide located at https://mbspartner.microsoft.com/BFI/Topic/64

Support elements: Interactivity and contact options
Element	Description	Example			
SHORT lead capture form	Include a lead capture form on your page.	./media/image68.jpg
		
Contact	Provide prospects with different contact options based on their readiness to interact with you.		./media/image69.jpg
	
AppSource app page	Include a link back to your listing on AppSource, so the prospect can return when ready.				
			Return to AppSource		
					
			./media/image70.jpg
	
Close them! Add a get started button	Include a very specific call-to-action button with the option to buy or try.		./media/image71.jpg
	
			./media/image72.jpg
	
					
•	Only ask for their name and email address, you can get the rest later.
•	Your forms should not have more than 4 or 5 fields to fill out. You have not yet earned the right or enough trust to ask for too much information at this point.
Most lead capture forms are way too long, demanding, and intimidating, and have low completion rates.
•	Note, nobody has the time or is willing to fill out an annoying form, which is of no value to them, especially if it is purely self-serving from your standpoint.
•	Ideally, include a phone number and an email address with an employee photo.
•	This alone could double your conversion rate.
link & social share
• Also, enable visitors to share and forward your app with others!
Checklist D: How to make compelling videos
Why use video?
Videos	Description
Why use video?	It is well worth investing time and resources to create marketing videos for your app, it is taken seriously in a business environment. Reasons why video is a superior medium
Speak to Specific Personas in your videos	You should create a video for each of the three core personas in the company:
•	Videos offers a very rich, stimulating communication medium that engages multiple senses.
•	Video engages the mind and triggers emotions, which makes it more compelling than text-based content.
•	Our brains have an easier time processing visual stories than bullet points or straight facts.
A recent Demand Gen survey indicated that 58% of B2B buyers consume video content, while Hyperfine media states that 59% of executives would rather watch video than read text. Also, 50% of executives look for more information after seeing a product/service in a video.
•	WHY persona: Owner/executive/leadership
•	HOW: Business line manager
•	WHAT: IT buyer, User
A horizontal generic message that attempts to speak to everyone will likely not reach anyone in an emotionally engaging way. Wasting a prospect’s time by requiring him/her to listen to irrelevant data or information will only create frustration and lead him/her to form a negative bias towards your company.
Choose the video format that is relevant for the audience that you want to target
Video types	Description
Video type 1: “Why” video	How to set up “Why” videos
•	Recommended length: 60-90 seconds • Purpose: o Your video should clearly communicate WHY prospects need to buy your solution now.
•	Focus: o Make sure the prospect is the hero of the story, not you or your company. Prospects are not interested in hearing about your company at this stage. They are simply trying to determine if what you offer is of value to THEM. o Your video should speak to the principal challenges and goals of your core decision-maker persona.
•	Describe the desired end state they will achieve by using your app.
•	A client/customer speaking about the benefits they received from your app is far more credible and compelling than anyone from your organization.
▪ Don’t only rely on “features” to acquire new customers.
How to speak to a WHY persona in a video
•	Target audience: o Owner/executive/leadership o They have limited time and financial resources as well as many competing priorities and resource requirements
•	You need to elevate the discussion to a strategic level, where you highlight market share, competitiveness, profitability, differentiation, revenue loss, and more.
•	Message: o The question you must answer beyond a doubt is WHY should they invest the time and money to buy your app? What will they get out of it?
•	Why should they spend money on a new system now? Can’t they put it off?
•	The WHY messaging teaches people something and it is industry specific and results oriented, as well as being memorable. It engages the emotional/limbic brain and leads to meaningful action
Video types	Description
Video type 2: “How & What” video	How to set up “How and What product videos” • Recommended length: Up to 3 minutes.
•	Purpose: o This video goes into greater depth communicating the main benefits of your app as well as HOW you solve your prospects’ problems. You can include some WHAT content.
•	Focus: o Demonstrating the proof of your claims is critical during this video.
•	Show very specific dashboards or visually show how you address prospect challenges.
•	If possible, use contrast to create desire and a sense of urgency. For example, you could show a complex, ugly data-filled forecast spreadsheet next to a beautiful visual dashboard stating “your sales forecast before and after.”
How to speak to a HOW persona: (Business line manager)
•	Target audience: Business Line Manager o HOW focuses on the operational benefits your solution will provide and HOW your organization will support the implementation.
•	Speaking to the HOW persona starts to separate you from the pack.
•	Message: o HOW content is VISUAL in nature and ACTION oriented. It allows your prospects to identify with you at a FUNCTIONAL business level and to Add-on with you. It provides evidence that your organization has relevant industry experience. Tribal acceptance increases, while risk decreases.
•	HOW messaging begins to appeal to the limbic brain because it is focused primarily on emotional business pains and problems.
How to speak to a WHAT persona: (IT buyer, User)
•	Target audience: IT-buyer, User o WHAT people are often tasked with finding a solution and are important influencers in the decision, but they are not the financial decision makers, and their opinions are easily overturned by HOW and WHY people in the organization. o Therefore, don’t invest all of your marketing time, money, and effort into providing content just for them.
•	Message: o You need to survive the WHAT inquisition and provide information about product-related features, functionality, and data so that prospects clearly understand your solution offering.
•	However, this will seldom trigger an emotional response and, therefore, it is likely there will be little or no emotional engagement with your content.
•	WHAT content is binary. WHAT content is a commodity. WHAT content is boring. Logical WHAT content is a necessary evil because many prospects initially go looking for it, but stopping here means remaining relevant only to WHAT personas.
Video types	Description
Video type 3: “Getting started” video	How to set up “Getting started videos”
Video type 4: “Customer testimony” video	How to set up “Customer testimonial videos” • Recommended length: Up to 2 minutes
•	Recommended length: 2–3 minutes maximum.
•	Purpose: This video should prove it is quick and easy to get up and running with your app.
•	Target: What personas (Users, It buyers)
•	Purpose: o Social reinforcement: Customer stories are the best proof of gain.
•	Focus: o A story coming directly from your client in the form of a testimonial is stronger than having your prospects take your word for it. If prospects see that other similar people orcompanies have already purchased your solution, then their natural response will be to more readily accept it as a solution for themselves
How to structure your video and practical things to keep in mind when producing videos
Video tips	Description
How to structure the flow in your video?	How to structure the flow in your video:
•	Gain immediate attention in the first 10 seconds of the video
Stimulate curiosity by include a hook phrase/comment that will elude to solving a pain point. Ask questions about the prospects’ core business challenges or ask about something they would like to do but can’t accomplish today.
•	Highlight the prospects’ problems:
Use an empathetic approach when describing their current situation and demonstrate that you understand their current business challenges. They must relate to this if they are to continue watching.
•	Give them new learning
Teach them something they don’t know. Demonstrate you have expertise and knowledge about their business or industry that they might not. Show you can offer strategic value to them.
•	Paint a picture of a desired outcome they would love to have or state they crave to experience
Highlight the benefits, rewards, and value they will enjoy after they purchase from you. Include both what it looks like and how it will feel.
•	Prove what you’re saying is true
Prospects don’t trust us when we say our products are great. Include objective and credible proof in the form of data, charts, graphs, quotes, statistics, or testimonials as evidence of your claims.
•	Ask them to take action
Include a call to action at the end of all videos. When viewers watch your videos, they should feel inspired to take the next step towards purchasing. Tell them what to do next and include an interactive link to the next step in the buying cycle. Use scarcity to compel them to action. Provide a timelimited offer or, for example, say it is “only for the first 20 customers”.
Video tips	Description
Practical things to keep in mind when producing and distributing your video	Does and don’t when producing your video
•	Don’t make the video too long
As our attention span is 8 seconds the ideal length of video is 90 seconds (minimum 30 seconds/maximum 2 minutes).
•	Add interactivity where possible
Overlay text, charts, animation, questions etc. Visually call out key messages.
•	Make sure your audio is high quality.
•	Make your video easily shareable
•	Enable your video to be shared on multiple media.
Track views and attention span. Observe and measure viewer patterns so that you can learn from prospects’ actual behaviors and then improve future content.

Video tips		Description
How to make a good	•	Your narrative should have a beginning, middle, and end.
	•	Speak directly to a particular persona in the second person.

	•	Ask rhetorical questions that stimulate pain and anxiety in your prospects in order to demonstrate that you understand their business problems.
	•	Use visual and auditory language to help the prospect imagine a new possible future.
	•	Use contrast whenever possible.
narrative that speak to the right persona in the right way?
•
•	Lead with a story, not with your app or the technology. o Don’t turn your videos into a product pitch.
•	You’ll build more brand affinity and trust by shedding light on a problem your prospects care about rather than by pitching your solutions to them directly.
The brain is on alert at the beginning of the video and at the end.
•	Make sure the first and last ten seconds are compelling, memorable, and interesting.
•	Do not talk about them in the third person, and avoid using terms like “our clients” and “companies”; instead, use “you” language as often as possible.
•	Use a lot of industry specific vocabulary, terminology, and visuals. If possible, film onsite at a customer’s location rather than in your office or in a studio.
•	Keep your delivery casual and authentic to instill trust. Speak directly to the prospect as if you were having a fireside chat
•	The prospect should be the hero of the story, i.e. do not speak about you and your company.
o For example: Are your margins decreasing? Having cash flow problems because you can’t collect payments sooner than 90 days? Had another large write off? Lost an important customer recently due to a late delivery?
o For example: “imagine seeing” , “picture yourself”, or “ how would you like to hear your clients say…” and so on.
•	Compare prospects’ experience now versus what it could be after the implementation of your solution.
•	Call out your competitive differentiators while anchoring your solution in prospects’ minds so that they can compare all others against the bar you set.
Video tips		Description
How to make a good narrative that speak to the right persona in the right way?	•	Where possible, use tangible, concrete language.
	•	Surprise and delight them.
•
•	Include quantifiable proof in the form of data or visual pictures.
•	No vague claims like “transform your business with the cloud”. This is an emotionless statement.
Providing customer references and testimonials is much more compelling and effective than selling your company or product yourself.
•	Let others speak for you. A customer testimonial video will always be more believable and compelling than a video of you saying the same thing.
o Use humor to make them smile. We take ourselves and our problems too seriously. Be warm, memorable, and unique.

15. Videos	In a Localization app videos are allowed in both English and/or a given local language. However, if videos are shot in local language, then they need to be subtitled/captioned in English.	Required
16. Documents	English is the de facto language that is used on AppSource to ease the validation process and create a uniform user experience.	Required
17. Screenshots	Screenshots are allowed in local language.	
For you, this means that both the storefront details of your app, and everything that is accessible through it must be in English too.
• This includes: your app’s landing page, videos, documentation – such as “Learn more” documents, factsheets, set up instructions, privacy policies, SLAs etc. – as well as help, support- and contact options.
Example of a screenshot in a local language (Korean) (cf. point 17) in the “Marketing artifacts” section of the Cloud partner portal:
