# Exporting Permission Sets
Permission sets that exist in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] can be exported and packaged for your extension directly from the client, instead of defining XML by hand. 

## To export permission sets
1. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], search for **Permission Sets**, and then choose the relevant link.
2. On the **Permission Sets** page, choose the permissions that you want to export, and then choose **Export Selected Permissions**.
3. In the **Export Permission Sets** dialog, choose to export permission sets only for the application, only for the tenant, or for both.
4. Save the file to your extension folder.
