# The Performance Toolkit Extension
Business Central often serves as a scalable platform on which ISVs and VARs deliver vertical solutions and customizations for specific customers. To keep performance levels high in customer tenants, and keep them current with major and minor updates in ISV solutions and customizations, it's important to thoroughly test changes in code before it's released. The Business Central Performance Toolkit helps you track and compare performance between builds of your solutions by simulating current and projected customer loads.

The Business Central Performance Toolkit is actually two extensions, the **Business Central Performance Toolkit** and the **Business Central Performance Toolkit Samples**.
