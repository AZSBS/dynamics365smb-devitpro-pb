# DataAccessIntent Property

Business Central artifacts (Reports, Pages, SOAP, and OData) now can get access to a read-only replica of the database. Sets whether the page is ReadWrite or ReadOnly.

## Applies To  

- Pages of the type API.

    The [Editable property](devenv-editable-property.md) must be set to **false**.

- Query
- Reports 

## Property Value

The following table describes the property values.  

|  Value  |  Description  |
|---------|---------------|  
|**ReadOnly**||  
|**ReadWrite**| |  
  


## Syntax
```
DataAccessIntent = ReadOnly|ReadWrite;
```

## Remarks  

This property works as a hint for the server, which will connect to the secondary replica if possible. When a workload is executed against the replica, insert/delete/modify operations are not possible, so a new validation is introduced for ReadOnly objects â€“ any of these operations will throw an exception at runtime (new compile-time validation will be added in the future).
