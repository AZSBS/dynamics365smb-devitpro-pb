# Clustered Property
Sets a value that indicates whether the index is clustered.  
  
## Applies To  

Table Keys  

> [!NOTE]  
> The `Clustered` property cannot be used in table extension objects.

## Remarks

A clustered index determines the physical order in which records are stored in the table. Using a clustered key can improve the time it takes to retrieve records. 

There can be only one clustered key on a table.
