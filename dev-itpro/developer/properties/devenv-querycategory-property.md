# QueryCategory Property

This property is used for displaying SmartLists in the UI. SmartLists are additional views of information linked to a master entity in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)]. SmartLists are displayed in the UI under any defined views.

SmartLists can be created based on queries. With this functionality, you can create your own lists through extensions. The created list can then be assigned to an entity by setting the `QueryCategory` property.

By being able to create a new list page based on a query, you can get the data you want on one list even if all the data isnâ€™t in a single table in the database.

On queries, the `QueryCategory` property specifies one or more query categories that the object supports. On pages, `QueryCategory` specifies the query category that the page supports.

## Applies to  

- Queries
- Pages

## Syntax


```
QueryCategory = 'Customer List', 'Vendor List';
```
