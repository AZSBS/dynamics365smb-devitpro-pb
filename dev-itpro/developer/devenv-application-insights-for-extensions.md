# Sending Extension Telemetry to Azure Application Insights

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2.md](../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

This article describes how to develop an extension to send telemetry data to an Azure Application Insights for monitoring and analyzing. [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] emits telemetry data for several operations that occur when extension code is run. You can configure an extension to send this telemetry data to a specific Application Insights resource on Microsoft Azure. For an overview about the telemetry with Application Insights, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](../administration/telemetry-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This feature targets publishers of per-tenant extensions to give them insight into issues in their extension before partners and customers report them. This feature is not supported for AppSource extensions, because these extensions are automatically set up to send telemetry to Application Insights.  


## Get an Application Insights resource in Azure

The first thing to do is to create an Application Insights resource in Azure if you don't have one. For more information, see [Create an Application Insights resource](/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource).

The Application Insights resource is assigned an instrumentation key. Copy this key because you'll need it to enable Application Insights in the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]


## Add the Application Insights Key to the extension's app.json

The next step is to add `"applicationInsightsKey"`setting the extension's app.json as shown:

``` 
"applicationInsightsKey":â€¯["<instrumenation key>"] 
```

Replace `<instrumenation key>` with your key. 

When done, build the extension package, then publish and install it as usual. When the extension is run from [!INCLUDE[prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)], Application Insights gathers the telemetry data for viewing.
