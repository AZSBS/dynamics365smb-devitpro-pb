# Application lifecycle management for solutions that use virtual entities

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This functionality requires version 10.0.12 for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] apps, while service update 189 is required for Common Data Service. The release information for Common Data Service is published on the [latest version availability page](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/dynamics/released-versions/dynamics-365ce#all-version-availability).

The application lifecycle for an end-to-end solution using [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] virtual entities will encompass both [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] as well as Common Data Service. This topic explains this in detail.

## Solution management

Virtual entities for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] don't exist in Common Data Service until they are created. Virtual entities must be created inside a solution. The MicrosoftOperationsERPVE solution is used for this purpose. This solution will contain all the virtual entities that are created from an instance of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].

MicrosoftOperationsERPVE is a [managed solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/introduction-solutions). By definition, a managed solution can't be modified after it has been generated. However, MicrosoftOperationsERPVE is a managed solution that grants privileges to update the components (that is, virtual entities) that are inside it. Therefore, new virtual entities can be added to the solution as they are created, and existing virtual entities can be updated as required. Nevertheless, the privileges to modify the managed solution are available only to the platform itself. Users can't make changes directly to the solution.

Because MicrosoftOperationsERPVE is a managed solution, solutions from customers, partners, and independent software vendors (ISVs) can take a dependency on it. This capability allows for consistent application lifecycle management (ALM) for solutions that use and depend on the virtual entities for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)].

When a solution that depends on MicrosoftOperationsERPVE is exported, placeholders for the virtual entities that are used in the solution are added in the exported solution. When that solution is imported into another Common Data Service environment, the import process also generates the dependent [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] virtual entities in the MicrosoftOperationsERPVE solution for the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance that is connected to the Common Data Service environment. Therefore, MicrosoftOperationsERPVE must already exist before a solution that depends on it is imported. Otherwise, an error message is shown. Additionally, if a dependent entity isn't available in the [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance, the virtual entity for that entity won't be generated. Virtual entities are generated only for entities that are available.

The following list describes other solutions that [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] virtual entities require to work, and that must be available in the Common Data Service environment:

- **MicrosoftOperationsERPCatalog** – This solution provides a catalog of the available entities in a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance. It also provides the connection that is used to set up a configuration. For more information, see the later sections of this topic.
- **MicrosoftOperationsVESupport** – This solution provides the virtual entity provider for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] apps. The provider can communicate with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] apps and Common Data Service. For more information, see the next section.
- **Dynamics365Company** – This solution adds the Company entity, which is referenced by all [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] entities that have a **PrimaryCompanyContext** metadata value.

All these solutions must be present in an environment. Otherwise, virtual entities won't work with [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] apps. These solutions are packaged together to allow for easier portability across environments.

## Managing entities from multiple environments

The MicrosoftOperationsVESupport solution consists of the **msdyn\_financeandoperationsvirtualentity** entity. This entity represents the virtual entity data source for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] that captures connection setup information. Each record in this entity represents a connection to a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance.

A catalog is used to list all the entities in a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance that are available for virtualization in Common Data Service (in other words, all the entities in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] that are enabled for Open Data Protocol \[OData\]). The catalog is part of the default MicrosoftOperationsERPCatalog solution and is applicable to a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance.

Note that each Common Data Service environment must point to only one [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance at any time, and each [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] environment must point to only one Common Data Service environment. Therefore, there should be only one record in the **msdyn\_financeandoperationsvirtualentity** entity.

The **mserp\_financeandoperationsentity** entity that represents the catalog can be queried to list the entities in a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance. Because this entity is a virtual entity, the catalog is never persisted in Common Data Service.

Notice that the name of the catalog entity has the "mserp\_" prefix. This prefix identifies the entities in the catalog as [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] entities. The same prefix is also added to the system names of the virtual entities that are generated for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] in the MicrosoftOperationsERPVE solution. Therefore, the maker can distinguish [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] virtual entities from other entities. The prefix is set in the managed solution and can't be changed.

### Managing entities from multiple ISV solutions

One or more ISV solutions will take a dependency on the MicrosoftOperationsERPVE solution to use virtual entities for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. Because custom entities in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] use the same catalog as out-of-box entities in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)], the virtual entities for custom [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] entities will also be generated in the MicrosoftOperationsERPVE solution.

The established guidelines and ALM for entity development in [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] ensure that there are no conflicting entity names across ISV solutions. Therefore, no conflicts of this type can occur when virtual entities are generated in Common Data Service for custom [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] entities from multiple ISV solutions. All virtual entities for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] entities, including custom entities, will have the "mserp\_" prefix that was mentioned earlier.

### Managing a Finance and Operation instance in a Common Data Service environment for virtual entities

One [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] instance must be linked to a Common Data Service environment for virtual entities. The connection setup information that is required is captured in a virtual entity data source for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)]. This data source is included in the MicrosoftOperationsERPCatalog solution.
