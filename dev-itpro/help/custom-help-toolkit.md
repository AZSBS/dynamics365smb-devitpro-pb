# Custom Help Toolkit

Microsoft has published a GitHub repository with scripts and tools that can help you prepare context-sensitive Help for your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] solution. This context-sensitive Help can be accessed from the user interface through the *Learn more* links as described in [Configure Context-Sensitive Help](context-sensitive-help.md). You are welcome to use any other tool or process to help you build and deploy content, and the toolkit is simply intended to help you in some of the steps that are required.

The GitHub repository includes source code for the tools, and we welcome contributions and feedback as we collaborate on making the toolkit develop over time.
