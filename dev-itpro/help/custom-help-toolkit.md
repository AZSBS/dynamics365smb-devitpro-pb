# Custom Help Toolkit

Microsoft has published a GitHub repository with scripts and tools that can help you prepare context-sensitive Help for your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] solution. This context-sensitive Help can be accessed from the user interface through the *Learn more* links as described in [Configure Context-Sensitive Help](context-sensitive-help.md). You are welcome to use any tools or processes to build and deploy content; this toolkit is intended to help you in some of the steps that are required.

The GitHub repository includes source code for the tools, and we welcome contributions and feedback to collaborate on improving the toolkit.  

## Tools in the toolkit

The toolkit is available at *TBD*. The repo contains the following tools and the source code for the tools:

- HtmlFromRepoGenerator tool

    For more information, see [Custom Help Toolkit: The HtmlFromRepoGenerator tool](custom-help-toolkit-HtmlFromRepoGenerator.md)
- Dynamics NAV field Help conversion scripts

    For more information, see [Custom Help Toolkit: The FieldTopicTextExtractor tool](custom-help-toolkit-FieldTopicTextExtractor.md)
- HtmlLocaleChanger tool

    For more information, see [Custom Help Toolkit: The HtmlLocaleChanger tool](custom-help-toolkit-HtmlLocaleChanger.md)

## Custom Help

Depending on your solution, you are expected to deploy Help to a website that can be accessed by users of your solution. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](../user-assistance.md) and [Configuring the Help Experience for [!INCLUDE[prodlong](../developer/includes/prodlong.md)]](../deployment/configure-help.md).
